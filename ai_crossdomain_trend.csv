"Use of semantic technologies for the development of a dynamic
  trajectories generator in a Semantic Chemistry eLearning platform","ChemgaPedia is a multimedia, webbased eLearning service platform that
currently contains about 18.000 pages organized in 1.700 chapters covering the
complete bachelor studies in chemistry and related topics of chemistry,
pharmacy, and life sciences. The eLearning encyclopedia contains some 25.000
media objects and the eLearning platform provides services such as virtual and
remote labs for experiments. With up to 350.000 users per month the platform is
the most frequently used scientific educational service in the German spoken
Internet. In this demo we show the benefit of mapping the static eLearning

Local Optima Networks of the Quadratic Assignment Problem,"Using a recently proposed model for combinatorial landscapes, Local Optima
Networks (LON), we conduct a thorough analysis of two types of instances of the
Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP). This network model is a reduction of the
landscape in which the nodes correspond to the local optima, and the edges
account for the notion of adjacency between their basins of attraction. The
model was inspired by the notion of 'inherent network' of potential energy
surfaces proposed in physical-chemistry. The local optima networks extracted
from the so called uniform and real-like QAP instances, show features clearly
distinguishing these two types of instances. Apart from a clear confirmation
that the search difficulty increases with the problem dimension, the analysis
provides new confirming evidence explaining why the real-like instances are
easier to solve exactly using heuristic search, while the uniform instances are
easier to solve approximately. Although the local optima network model is still
under development, we argue that it provides a novel view of combinatorial
landscapes, opening up the possibilities for new analytical tools and
understanding of problem difficulty in combinatorial optimization.",2011-07-21,2011,2011-07,chemistry
Ontologies for the Integration of Air Quality Models and 3D City Models,"The holistic approach to sustainable urban planning implies using different
models in an integrated way that is capable of simulating the urban system. As
the interconnection of such models is not a trivial task, one of the key
elements that may be applied is the description of the urban geometric
properties in an ""interoperable"" way. Focusing on air quality as one of the
most pronounced urban problems, the geometric aspects of a city may be
described by objects such as those defined in CityGML, so that an appropriate
air quality model can be applied for estimating the quality of the urban air on
the basis of atmospheric flow and chemistry equations.
  In this paper we first present theoretical background and motivations for the
interconnection of 3D city models and other models related to sustainable
development and urban planning. Then we present a practical experiment based on
the interconnection of CityGML with an air quality model. Our approach is based
on the creation of an ontology of air quality models and on the extension of an
ontology of urban planning process (OUPP) that acts as an ontology mediator.",2012-01-31,2012,2012-01,chemistry
"What's in an `is about' link? Chemical diagrams and the Information
  Artifact Ontology","The Information Artifact Ontology is an ontology in the domain of information
entities. Core to the definition of what it is to be an information entity is
the claim that an information entity must be `about' something, which is
encoded in an axiom expressing that all information entities are about some
entity. This axiom comes into conflict with ontological realism, since many
information entities seem to be about non-existing entities, such as
hypothetical molecules. We discuss this problem in the context of diagrams of
molecules, a kind of information entity pervasively used throughout
computational chemistry. We then propose a solution that recognizes that
information entities such as diagrams are expressions of diagrammatic
languages. In so doing, we not only address the problem of classifying diagrams
that seem to be about non-existing entities but also allow a more sophisticated
categorisation of information entities.",2012-04-21,2012,2012-04,chemistry
Design for a Darwinian Brain: Part 1. Philosophy and Neuroscience,"Physical symbol systems are needed for open-ended cognition. A good way to
understand physical symbol systems is by comparison of thought to chemistry.
Both have systematicity, productivity and compositionality. The state of the
art in cognitive architectures for open-ended cognition is critically assessed.
I conclude that a cognitive architecture that evolves symbol structures in the
brain is a promising candidate to explain open-ended cognition. Part 2 of the
paper presents such a cognitive architecture.",2013-03-28,2013,2013-03,chemistry
"Chemlambda, universality and self-multiplication","We present chemlambda (or the chemical concrete machine), an artificial
chemistry with the following properties: (a) is Turing complete, (b) has a
model of decentralized, distributed computing associated to it, (c) works at
the level of individual (artificial) molecules, subject of reversible, but
otherwise deterministic interactions with a small number of enzymes, (d)
encodes information in the geometrical structure of the molecules and not in
their numbers, (e) all interactions are purely local in space and time. This is
part of a larger project to create computing, artificial chemistry and
artificial life in a distributed context, using topological and graphical
languages.",2014-03-31,2014,2014-03,chemistry
Prediction of Radiation Fog by DNA Computing,"In this paper we propose a wet lab algorithm for prediction of radiation fog
by DNA computing. The concept of DNA computing is essentially exploited for
generating the classifier algorithm in the wet lab. The classifier is based on
a new concept of similarity based fuzzy reasoning suitable for wet lab
implementation. This new concept of similarity based fuzzy reasoning is
different from conventional approach to fuzzy reasoning based on similarity
measure and also replaces the logical aspect of classical fuzzy reasoning by
DNA chemistry. Thus, we add a new dimension to existing forms of fuzzy
reasoning by bringing it down to nanoscale. We exploit the concept of massive
parallelism of DNA computing by designing this new classifier in the wet lab.
This newly designed classifier is very much generalized in nature and apart
from prediction of radiation fog this methodology can be applied to other types
of data also. To achieve our goal we first fuzzify the given observed
parameters in a form of synthetic DNA sequence which is called fuzzy DNA and
which handles the vague concept of human reasoning.",2015-07-07,2015,2015-07,chemistry
"Enacting textual entailment and ontologies for automated essay grading
  in chemical domain","We propose a system for automated essay grading using ontologies and textual
entailment. The process of textual entailment is guided by hypotheses, which
are extracted from a domain ontology. Textual entailment checks if the truth of
the hypothesis follows from a given text. We enact textual entailment to
compare students answer to a model answer obtained from ontology. We validated
the solution against various essays written by students in the chemistry
domain.",2015-11-09,2015,2015-11,chemistry
Gated Graph Sequence Neural Networks,"Graph-structured data appears frequently in domains including chemistry,
natural language semantics, social networks, and knowledge bases. In this work,
we study feature learning techniques for graph-structured inputs. Our starting
point is previous work on Graph Neural Networks (Scarselli et al., 2009), which
we modify to use gated recurrent units and modern optimization techniques and
then extend to output sequences. The result is a flexible and broadly useful
class of neural network models that has favorable inductive biases relative to
purely sequence-based models (e.g., LSTMs) when the problem is
graph-structured. We demonstrate the capabilities on some simple AI (bAbI) and
graph algorithm learning tasks. We then show it achieves state-of-the-art
performance on a problem from program verification, in which subgraphs need to
be matched to abstract data structures.",2015-11-17,2015,2015-11,chemistry
A Chain-Detection Algorithm for Two-Dimensional Grids,"We describe a general method of detecting valid chains or links of pieces on
a two-dimensional grid. Specifically, using the example of the chess variant
known as Switch-Side Chain-Chess (SSCC). Presently, no foolproof method of
detecting such chains in any given chess position is known and existing graph
theory, to our knowledge, is unable to fully address this problem either. We
therefore propose a solution implemented and tested using the C++ programming
language. We have been unable to find an incorrect result and therefore offer
it as the most viable solution thus far to the chain-detection problem in this
chess variant. The algorithm is also scalable, in principle, to areas beyond
two-dimensional grids such as 3D analysis and molecular chemistry.",2016-10-12,2016,2016-10,chemistry
"Theory-guided Data Science: A New Paradigm for Scientific Discovery from
  Data","Data science models, although successful in a number of commercial domains,
have had limited applicability in scientific problems involving complex
physical phenomena. Theory-guided data science (TGDS) is an emerging paradigm
that aims to leverage the wealth of scientific knowledge for improving the
effectiveness of data science models in enabling scientific discovery. The
overarching vision of TGDS is to introduce scientific consistency as an
essential component for learning generalizable models. Further, by producing
scientifically interpretable models, TGDS aims to advance our scientific
understanding by discovering novel domain insights. Indeed, the paradigm of
TGDS has started to gain prominence in a number of scientific disciplines such
as turbulence modeling, material discovery, quantum chemistry, bio-medical
science, bio-marker discovery, climate science, and hydrology. In this paper,
we formally conceptualize the paradigm of TGDS and present a taxonomy of
research themes in TGDS. We describe several approaches for integrating domain
knowledge in different research themes using illustrative examples from
different disciplines. We also highlight some of the promising avenues of novel
research for realizing the full potential of theory-guided data science.",2016-12-27,2016,2016-12,chemistry
Deep Learning for Computational Chemistry,"The rise and fall of artificial neural networks is well documented in the
scientific literature of both computer science and computational chemistry. Yet
almost two decades later, we are now seeing a resurgence of interest in deep
learning, a machine learning algorithm based on multilayer neural networks.
Within the last few years, we have seen the transformative impact of deep
learning in many domains, particularly in speech recognition and computer
vision, to the extent that the majority of expert practitioners in those field
are now regularly eschewing prior established models in favor of deep learning
models. In this review, we provide an introductory overview into the theory of
deep neural networks and their unique properties that distinguish them from
traditional machine learning algorithms used in cheminformatics. By providing
an overview of the variety of emerging applications of deep neural networks, we
highlight its ubiquity and broad applicability to a wide range of challenges in
the field, including QSAR, virtual screening, protein structure prediction,
quantum chemistry, materials design and property prediction. In reviewing the
performance of deep neural networks, we observed a consistent outperformance
against non-neural networks state-of-the-art models across disparate research
topics, and deep neural network based models often exceeded the ""glass ceiling""
expectations of their respective tasks. Coupled with the maturity of
GPU-accelerated computing for training deep neural networks and the exponential
growth of chemical data on which to train these networks on, we anticipate that
deep learning algorithms will be a valuable tool for computational chemistry.",2017-01-17,2017,2017-01,chemistry
"Towards ""AlphaChem"": Chemical Synthesis Planning with Tree Search and
  Deep Neural Network Policies","Retrosynthesis is a technique to plan the chemical synthesis of organic
molecules, for example drugs, agro- and fine chemicals. In retrosynthesis, a
search tree is built by analysing molecules recursively and dissecting them
into simpler molecular building blocks until one obtains a set of known
building blocks. The search space is intractably large, and it is difficult to
determine the value of retrosynthetic positions. Here, we propose to model
retrosynthesis as a Markov Decision Process. In combination with a Deep Neural
Network policy learned from essentially the complete published knowledge of
chemistry, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) can be used to evaluate positions. In
exploratory studies, we demonstrate that MCTS with neural network policies
outperforms the traditionally used best-first search with hand-coded
heuristics.",2017-01-31,2017,2017-01,chemistry
CLBlast: A Tuned OpenCL BLAS Library,"This work introduces CLBlast, an open-source BLAS library providing optimized
OpenCL routines to accelerate dense linear algebra for a wide variety of
devices. It is targeted at machine learning and HPC applications and thus
provides a fast matrix-multiplication routine (GEMM) to accelerate the core of
many applications (e.g. deep learning, iterative solvers, astrophysics,
computational fluid dynamics, quantum chemistry). CLBlast has five main
advantages over other OpenCL BLAS libraries: 1) it is optimized for and tested
on a large variety of OpenCL devices including less commonly used devices such
as embedded and low-power GPUs, 2) it can be explicitly tuned for specific
problem-sizes on specific hardware platforms, 3) it can perform operations in
half-precision floating-point FP16 saving bandwidth, time and energy, 4) it has
an optional CUDA back-end, 5) and it can combine multiple operations in a
single batched routine, accelerating smaller problems significantly. This paper
describes the library and demonstrates the advantages of CLBlast experimentally
for different use-cases on a wide variety of OpenCL hardware.",2017-05-12,2017,2017-05,chemistry
"Chemception: A Deep Neural Network with Minimal Chemistry Knowledge
  Matches the Performance of Expert-developed QSAR/QSPR Models","In the last few years, we have seen the transformative impact of deep
learning in many applications, particularly in speech recognition and computer
vision. Inspired by Google's Inception-ResNet deep convolutional neural network
(CNN) for image classification, we have developed ""Chemception"", a deep CNN for
the prediction of chemical properties, using just the images of 2D drawings of
molecules. We develop Chemception without providing any additional explicit
chemistry knowledge, such as basic concepts like periodicity, or advanced
features like molecular descriptors and fingerprints. We then show how
Chemception can serve as a general-purpose neural network architecture for
predicting toxicity, activity, and solvation properties when trained on a
modest database of 600 to 40,000 compounds. When compared to multi-layer
perceptron (MLP) deep neural networks trained with ECFP fingerprints,
Chemception slightly outperforms in activity and solvation prediction and
slightly underperforms in toxicity prediction. Having matched the performance
of expert-developed QSAR/QSPR deep learning models, our work demonstrates the
plausibility of using deep neural networks to assist in computational chemistry
research, where the feature engineering process is performed primarily by a
deep learning algorithm.",2017-06-20,2017,2017-06,chemistry
Learning to Plan Chemical Syntheses,"From medicines to materials, small organic molecules are indispensable for
human well-being. To plan their syntheses, chemists employ a problem solving
technique called retrosynthesis. In retrosynthesis, target molecules are
recursively transformed into increasingly simpler precursor compounds until a
set of readily available starting materials is obtained. Computer-aided
retrosynthesis would be a highly valuable tool, however, past approaches were
slow and provided results of unsatisfactory quality. Here, we employ Monte
Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to efficiently discover retrosynthetic routes. MCTS
was combined with an expansion policy network that guides the search, and an
""in-scope"" filter network to pre-select the most promising retrosynthetic
steps. These deep neural networks were trained on 12 million reactions, which
represents essentially all reactions ever published in organic chemistry. Our
system solves almost twice as many molecules and is 30 times faster in
comparison to the traditional search method based on extracted rules and
hand-coded heuristics. Finally after a 60 year history of computer-aided
synthesis planning, chemists can no longer distinguish between routes generated
by a computer system and real routes taken from the scientific literature. We
anticipate that our method will accelerate drug and materials discovery by
assisting chemists to plan better syntheses faster, and by enabling fully
automated robot synthesis.",2017-08-14,2017,2017-08,chemistry
Predicting Organic Reaction Outcomes with Weisfeiler-Lehman Network,"The prediction of organic reaction outcomes is a fundamental problem in
computational chemistry. Since a reaction may involve hundreds of atoms, fully
exploring the space of possible transformations is intractable. The current
solution utilizes reaction templates to limit the space, but it suffers from
coverage and efficiency issues. In this paper, we propose a template-free
approach to efficiently explore the space of product molecules by first
pinpointing the reaction center -- the set of nodes and edges where graph edits
occur. Since only a small number of atoms contribute to reaction center, we can
directly enumerate candidate products. The generated candidates are scored by a
Weisfeiler-Lehman Difference Network that models high-order interactions
between changes occurring at nodes across the molecule. Our framework
outperforms the top-performing template-based approach with a 10\% margin,
while running orders of magnitude faster. Finally, we demonstrate that the
model accuracy rivals the performance of domain experts.",2017-09-13,2017,2017-09,chemistry
"How Much Chemistry Does a Deep Neural Network Need to Know to Make
  Accurate Predictions?","The meteoric rise of deep learning models in computer vision research, having
achieved human-level accuracy in image recognition tasks is firm evidence of
the impact of representation learning of deep neural networks. In the chemistry
domain, recent advances have also led to the development of similar CNN models,
such as Chemception, that is trained to predict chemical properties using
images of molecular drawings. In this work, we investigate the effects of
systematically removing and adding localized domain-specific information to the
image channels of the training data. By augmenting images with only 3
additional basic information, and without introducing any architectural
changes, we demonstrate that an augmented Chemception (AugChemception)
outperforms the original model in the prediction of toxicity, activity, and
solvation free energy. Then, by altering the information content in the images,
and examining the resulting model's performance, we also identify two distinct
learning patterns in predicting toxicity/activity as compared to solvation free
energy. These patterns suggest that Chemception is learning about its tasks in
the manner that is consistent with established knowledge. Thus, our work
demonstrates that advanced chemical knowledge is not a pre-requisite for deep
learning models to accurately predict complex chemical properties.",2017-10-05,2017,2017-10,chemistry
Distributed Kernel K-Means for Large Scale Clustering,"Clustering samples according to an effective metric and/or vector space
representation is a challenging unsupervised learning task with a wide spectrum
of applications. Among several clustering algorithms, k-means and its
kernelized version have still a wide audience because of their conceptual
simplicity and efficacy. However, the systematic application of the kernelized
version of k-means is hampered by its inherent square scaling in memory with
the number of samples. In this contribution, we devise an approximate strategy
to minimize the kernel k-means cost function in which the trade-off between
accuracy and velocity is automatically ruled by the available system memory.
Moreover, we define an ad-hoc parallelization scheme well suited for hybrid
cpu-gpu state-of-the-art parallel architectures. We proved the effectiveness
both of the approximation scheme and of the parallelization method on standard
UCI datasets and on molecular dynamics (MD) data in the realm of computational
chemistry. In this applicative domain, clustering can play a key role for both
quantitively estimating kinetics rates via Markov State Models or to give
qualitatively a human compatible summarization of the underlying chemical
phenomenon under study. For these reasons, we selected it as a valuable
real-world application scenario.",2017-10-09,2017,2017-10,chemistry
"Using Rule-Based Labels for Weak Supervised Learning: A ChemNet for
  Transferable Chemical Property Prediction","With access to large datasets, deep neural networks (DNN) have achieved
human-level accuracy in image and speech recognition tasks. However, in
chemistry, data is inherently small and fragmented. In this work, we develop an
approach of using rule-based knowledge for training ChemNet, a transferable and
generalizable deep neural network for chemical property prediction that learns
in a weak-supervised manner from large unlabeled chemical databases. When
coupled with transfer learning approaches to predict other smaller datasets for
chemical properties that it was not originally trained on, we show that
ChemNet's accuracy outperforms contemporary DNN models that were trained using
conventional supervised learning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the ChemNet
pre-training approach is equally effective on both CNN (Chemception) and RNN
(SMILES2vec) models, indicating that this approach is network architecture
agnostic and is effective across multiple data modalities. Our results indicate
a pre-trained ChemNet that incorporates chemistry domain knowledge, enables the
development of generalizable neural networks for more accurate prediction of
novel chemical properties.",2017-12-07,2017,2017-12,chemistry
A bright future for financial agent-based models,"The history of research in finance and economics has been widely impacted by
the field of Agent-based Computational Economics (ACE). While at the same time
being popular among natural science researchers for its proximity to the
successful methods of physics and chemistry for example, the field of ACE has
also received critics by a part of the social science community for its lack of
empiricism. Yet recent trends have shifted the weights of these general
arguments and potentially given ACE a whole new range of realism. At the base
of these trends are found two present-day major scientific breakthroughs: the
steady shift of psychology towards a hard science due to the advances of
neuropsychology, and the progress of artificial intelligence and more
specifically machine learning due to increasing computational power and big
data. These two have also found common fields of study in the form of
computational neuroscience, and human-computer interaction, among others. We
outline here the main lines of a computational research study of collective
economic behavior via Agent-Based Models (ABM) or Multi-Agent System (MAS),
where each agent would be endowed with specific cognitive and behavioral biases
known to the field of neuroeconomics, and at the same time autonomously
implement rational quantitative financial strategies updated by machine
learning. We postulate that such ABMs would offer a whole new range of realism.",2018-01-24,2018,2018-01,chemistry
"Tensor field networks: Rotation- and translation-equivariant neural
  networks for 3D point clouds","We introduce tensor field neural networks, which are locally equivariant to
3D rotations, translations, and permutations of points at every layer. 3D
rotation equivariance removes the need for data augmentation to identify
features in arbitrary orientations. Our network uses filters built from
spherical harmonics; due to the mathematical consequences of this filter
choice, each layer accepts as input (and guarantees as output) scalars,
vectors, and higher-order tensors, in the geometric sense of these terms. We
demonstrate the capabilities of tensor field networks with tasks in geometry,
physics, and chemistry.",2018-02-22,2018,2018-02,chemistry
Fractal AI: A fragile theory of intelligence,"Fractal AI is a theory for general artificial intelligence. It allows
deriving new mathematical tools that constitute the foundations for a new kind
of stochastic calculus, by modelling information using cellular automaton-like
structures instead of smooth functions. In the repository included we are
presenting a new Agent, derived from the first principles of the theory, which
is capable of solving Atari games several orders of magnitude more efficiently
than other similar techniques, like Monte Carlo Tree Search. The code provided
shows how it is now possible to beat some of the current State of The Art
benchmarks on Atari games, without previous learning and using less than 1000
samples to calculate each one of the actions when standard MCTS uses 3 Million
samples. Among other things, Fractal AI makes it possible to generate a huge
database of top performing examples with a very little amount of computation
required, transforming Reinforcement Learning into a supervised problem. The
algorithm presented is capable of solving the exploration vs exploitation
dilemma on both the discrete and continuous cases, while maintaining control
over any aspect of the behaviour of the Agent. From a general approach, new
techniques presented here have direct applications to other areas such as
Non-equilibrium thermodynamics, chemistry, quantum physics, economics,
information theory, and non-linear control theory.",2018-03-13,2018,2018-03,chemistry
"Unraveling Go gaming nature by Ising Hamiltonian and common fate graphs:
  tactics and statistics","Go gaming is a struggle between adversaries, black and white simple stones,
and aim to control the most Go board territory for success. Rules are simple
but Go game fighting is highly intricate. Stones placement and interaction on
board is random-appearance, likewise interaction phenomena among basic elements
in physics thermodynamics, chemistry, biology, or social issues. We model the
Go game dynamic employing an Ising model energy function, whose interaction
coefficients reflect the application of rules and tactics to build long-term
strategies. At any step of the game, the energy function of the model assesses
the control and strength of a player over the board. A close fit between
predictions of the model with actual game's scores is obtained. AlphaGo
computer is the current top Go player, but its behavior does not wholly reveal
the Go gaming nature. The Ising function allows for precisely model the
stochastic evolutions of Go gaming patterns, so, to advance the understanding
on Go own-dynamic -beyond the player`s abilities. The analysis of the frequency
and combination of tactics shows the formation of patterns in the groups of
stones during a game, regarding the turn of each player, or if human or
computer adversaries are confronted.",2018-03-15,2018,2018-03,chemistry
"Graph Convolutional Policy Network for Goal-Directed Molecular Graph
  Generation","Generating novel graph structures that optimize given objectives while
obeying some given underlying rules is fundamental for chemistry, biology and
social science research. This is especially important in the task of molecular
graph generation, whose goal is to discover novel molecules with desired
properties such as drug-likeness and synthetic accessibility, while obeying
physical laws such as chemical valency. However, designing models to find
molecules that optimize desired properties while incorporating highly complex
and non-differentiable rules remains to be a challenging task. Here we propose
Graph Convolutional Policy Network (GCPN), a general graph convolutional
network based model for goal-directed graph generation through reinforcement
learning. The model is trained to optimize domain-specific rewards and
adversarial loss through policy gradient, and acts in an environment that
incorporates domain-specific rules. Experimental results show that GCPN can
achieve 61% improvement on chemical property optimization over state-of-the-art
baselines while resembling known molecules, and achieve 184% improvement on the
constrained property optimization task.",2018-06-07,2018,2018-06,chemistry
"Jointly learning relevant subgraph patterns and nonlinear models of
  their indicators","Classification and regression in which the inputs are graphs of arbitrary
size and shape have been paid attention in various fields such as computational
chemistry and bioinformatics. Subgraph indicators are often used as the most
fundamental features, but the number of possible subgraph patterns are
intractably large due to the combinatorial explosion. We propose a novel
efficient algorithm to jointly learn relevant subgraph patterns and nonlinear
models of their indicators. Previous methods for such joint learning of
subgraph features and models are based on search for single best subgraph
features with specific pruning and boosting procedures of adding their
indicators one by one, which result in linear models of subgraph indicators. In
contrast, the proposed approach is based on directly learning regression trees
for graph inputs using a newly derived bound of the total sum of squares for
data partitions by a given subgraph feature, and thus can learn nonlinear
models through standard gradient boosting. An illustrative example we call the
Graph-XOR problem to consider nonlinearity, numerical experiments with real
datasets, and scalability comparisons to naive approaches using explicit
pattern enumeration are also presented.",2018-07-09,2018,2018-07,chemistry
"Evaluation as a Service architecture and crowdsourced problems solving
  implemented in Optil.io platform","Reliable and trustworthy evaluation of algorithms is a challenging process.
Firstly, each algorithm has its strengths and weaknesses, and the selection of
test instances can significantly influence the assessment process. Secondly,
the measured performance of the algorithm highly depends on the test
environment architecture, i.e., CPU model, available memory, cache
configuration, operating system's kernel, and even compilation flags. Finally,
it is often difficult to compare algorithm with software prepared by other
researchers. Evaluation as a Service (EaaS) is a cloud computing architecture
that tries to make assessment process more reliable by providing online tools
and test instances dedicated to the evaluation of algorithms. One of such
platforms is Optil.io which gives the possibility to define problems, store
evaluation data and evaluate solutions submitted by researchers in almost real

challenges that were organized with its support.",2018-07-14,2018,2018-07,chemistry
Optimization of Molecules via Deep Reinforcement Learning,"We present a framework, which we call Molecule Deep $Q$-Networks (MolDQN),
for molecule optimization by combining domain knowledge of chemistry and
state-of-the-art reinforcement learning techniques (double $Q$-learning and
randomized value functions). We directly define modifications on molecules,
thereby ensuring 100\% chemical validity. Further, we operate without
pre-training on any dataset to avoid possible bias from the choice of that set.
Inspired by problems faced during medicinal chemistry lead optimization, we
extend our model with multi-objective reinforcement learning, which maximizes
drug-likeness while maintaining similarity to the original molecule. We further
show the path through chemical space to achieve optimization for a molecule to
understand how the model works.",2018-10-19,2018,2018-10,chemistry
"Physics Guided RNNs for Modeling Dynamical Systems: A Case Study in
  Simulating Lake Temperature Profiles","This paper proposes a physics-guided recurrent neural network model (PGRNN)
that combines RNNs and physics-based models to leverage their complementary
strengths and improve the modeling of physical processes. Specifically, we show
that a PGRNN can improve prediction accuracy over that of physical models,
while generating outputs consistent with physical laws, and achieving good
generalizability. Standard RNNs, even when producing superior prediction
accuracy, often produce physically inconsistent results and lack
generalizability. We further enhance this approach by using a pre-training
method that leverages the simulated data from a physics-based model to address
the scarcity of observed data. The PGRNN has the flexibility to incorporate
additional physical constraints and we incorporate a density-depth
relationship. Both enhancements further improve PGRNN performance. Although we
present and evaluate this methodology in the context of modeling the dynamics
of temperature in lakes, it is applicable more widely to a range of scientific
and engineering disciplines where mechanistic (also known as process-based)
models are used, e.g., power engineering, climate science, materials science,
computational chemistry, and biomedicine.",2018-10-31,2018,2018-10,chemistry
"Multi-Label Robust Factorization Autoencoder and its Application in
  Predicting Drug-Drug Interactions","Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are a major cause of preventable
hospitalizations and deaths. Predicting the occurrence of DDIs helps drug
safety professionals allocate investigative resources and take appropriate
regulatory action promptly. Traditional DDI prediction methods predict DDIs
based on the similarity between drugs. Recently, researchers revealed that
predictive performance can be improved by better modeling the interactions
between drug pairs with bilinear forms. However, the shallow models leveraging
bilinear forms suffer from limitations on capturing complicated nonlinear
interactions between drug pairs. To this end, we propose Multi-Label Robust
Factorization Autoencoder (abbreviated to MuLFA) for DDI prediction, which
learns a representation of interactions between drug pairs and has the
capability of characterizing complicated nonlinear interactions more precisely.
Moreover, a novel loss called CuXCov is designed to effectively learn the
parameters of MuLFA. Furthermore, the decoder is able to generate high-risk
chemical structures of drug pairs for specific DDIs, assisting pharmacists to
better understand the relationship between drug chemistry and DDI. Experimental
results on real-world datasets demonstrate that MuLFA consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods; particularly, it increases 21:3% predictive
performance compared to the best baseline for top 50 frequent DDIs.We also
illustrate various case studies to demonstrate the efficacy of the chemical
structures generated by MuLFA in DDI diagnosis.",2018-11-01,2018,2018-11,chemistry

  Reference Parsers","Bibliographic reference parsers extract machine-readable metadata such as
author names, title, journal, and year from bibliographic reference strings. To
extract the metadata, the parsers apply heuristics or machine learning.
However, no reference parser, and no algorithm, consistently gives the best
results in every scenario. For instance, one tool may be best in extracting
titles in ACM citation style, but only third best when APA is used. Another
tool may be best in extracting English author names, while another one is best
for noisy data (i.e. inconsistent citation styles). In this paper, which is an
extended version of our recent RecSys poster, we address the problem of
reference parsing from a recommender-systems and meta-learning perspective. We
propose ParsRec, a meta-learning based recommender-system that recommends the
potentially most effective parser for a given reference string. ParsRec
recommends one out of 10 open-source parsers: Anystyle-Parser, Biblio, CERMINE,
Citation, Citation-Parser, GROBID, ParsCit, PDFSSA4MET, Reference Tagger, and
Science Parse. We evaluate ParsRec on 105k references from chemistry. We
propose two approaches to meta-learning recommendations. The first approach
learns the best parser for an entire reference string. The second approach
learns the best parser for each metadata type in a reference string. The second
approach achieved a 2.6% increase in F1 (0.909 vs. 0.886) over the best single
parser (GROBID), reducing the false positive rate by 20.2% (0.075 vs. 0.094),
and the false negative rate by 18.9% (0.107 vs. 0.132).",2018-11-26,2018,2018-11,chemistry
"Molecular Sets (MOSES): A Benchmarking Platform for Molecular Generation
  Models","Generative models are becoming a tool of choice for exploring the molecular

molecular structures with similar properties. Generated structures can be
utilized for virtual screening or training semi-supervised predictive models in
the downstream tasks. While there are plenty of generative models, it is
unclear how to compare and rank them. In this work, we introduce a benchmarking
platform called Molecular Sets (MOSES) to standardize training and comparison
of molecular generative models. MOSES provides a training and testing datasets,
and a set of metrics to evaluate the quality and diversity of generated

Tensor networks for complex quantum systems,"Tensor network states and methods have erupted in recent years. Originally
developed in the context of condensed matter physics and based on
renormalization group ideas, tensor networks lived a revival thanks to quantum
information theory and the understanding of entanglement in quantum many-body
systems. Moreover, it has been not-so-long realized that tensor network states
play a key role in other scientific disciplines, such as quantum gravity and
artificial intelligence. In this context, here we provide an overview of basic
concepts and key developments in the field. In particular, we briefly discuss
the most important tensor network structures and algorithms, together with a
sketch on advances related to global and gauge symmetries, fermions,
topological order, classification of phases, entanglement Hamiltonians,
AdS/CFT, artificial intelligence, the 2d Hubbard model, 2d quantum

of things and artificial intelligence as well as many related applications is
largely associated with memristive elements. This technology offers a broad
spectrum of functionalities, however, it follows predominantly a
phenomenological approach and crucial challenge/limit for further development
remains variability and lack of fundamental materials' design strategy. Here we
demonstrate the vital importance of materials' purity for determining
memristors' functionalities, showing that part per million foreign elements
significantly change the performance. By appropriate choice of chemistry and
amount of doping material we can selectively enhance desired operation mode. We
highlight how dopant dependent structure and charge/potential distribution in
the space charge layers and the cell capacitance determine the device kinetics

Atomistic structure learning,"One endeavour of modern physical chemistry is to use bottom-up approaches to
design materials and drugs with desired properties. Here we introduce an
atomistic structure learning algorithm (ASLA) that utilizes a convolutional
neural network to build 2D compounds and layered structures atom by atom. The
algorithm takes no prior data or knowledge on atomic interactions but inquires
a first-principles quantum mechanical program for physical properties. Using
reinforcement learning, the algorithm accumulates knowledge of chemical
compound space for a given number and type of atoms and stores this in the
neural network, ultimately learning the blueprint for the optimal structural
arrangement of the atoms for a given target property. ASLA is demonstrated to
work on diverse problems, including grain boundaries in graphene sheets,
organic compound formation and a surface oxide structure. This approach to
structure prediction is a first step toward direct manipulation of atoms with
artificially intelligent first principles computer codes.",2019-02-27,2019,2019-02,chemistry

exhibit. The CA-robot is designed to explore formulations in an open-ended way
with no explicit optimization target. By applying the CA-robot to the study of
self-propelling multicomponent oil-in-water droplets, we are able to observe an
order of magnitude more variety of droplet behaviours than possible with a
random parameter search and given the same budget. We demonstrate that the
CA-robot enabled the discovery of a sudden and highly specific response of
droplets to slight temperature changes. Six modes of self-propelled droplets

emphasis on our recent work in quantum algorithms and applications, in
elucidating mechanisms of quantum mechanics and their uses for quantum
computational purposes, and in simulation, compilation, and physics-inspired
classical algorithms. To our early application thrusts in planning and

"Molecular Property Prediction: A Multilevel Quantum Interactions
  Modeling Perspective","Predicting molecular properties (e.g., atomization energy) is an essential
issue in quantum chemistry, which could speed up much research progress, such
as drug designing and substance discovery. Traditional studies based on density
functional theory (DFT) in physics are proved to be time-consuming for
predicting large number of molecules. Recently, the machine learning methods,
which consider much rule-based information, have also shown potentials for this
issue. However, the complex inherent quantum interactions of molecules are
still largely underexplored by existing solutions. In this paper, we propose a
generalizable and transferable Multilevel Graph Convolutional neural Network
(MGCN) for molecular property prediction. Specifically, we represent each
molecule as a graph to preserve its internal structure. Moreover, the
well-designed hierarchical graph neural network directly extracts features from
the conformation and spatial information followed by the multilevel
interactions. As a consequence, the multilevel overall representations can be
utilized to make the prediction. Extensive experiments on both datasets of
equilibrium and off-equilibrium molecules demonstrate the effectiveness of our
model. Furthermore, the detailed results also prove that MGCN is generalizable
and transferable for the prediction.",2019-06-25,2019,2019-06,chemistry
"The Ramanujan Machine: Automatically Generated Conjectures on
  Fundamental Constants","Fundamental mathematical constants like $e$ and $\pi$ are ubiquitous in
diverse fields of science, from abstract mathematics to physics, biology and
chemistry. For centuries, new formulas relating fundamental constants have been
scarce and usually discovered sporadically. Here we propose a novel and
systematic approach that leverages algorithms for deriving mathematical
formulas for fundamental constants and help reveal their underlying structure.
Our algorithms find dozens of well-known as well as previously unknown
continued fraction representations of $\pi$, $e$, Catalan's constant, and
values of the Riemann zeta function. Two example conjectures found by our
algorithm and so far unproven are: \begin{equation*} \frac{24}{\pi^2} = 2 +
7\cdot 0\cdot 1+ \frac{8\cdot1^4}{2 + 7\cdot 1\cdot 2 + \frac{8\cdot2^4}{2 +
7\cdot 2\cdot 3 + \frac{8\cdot3^4}{2 + 7\cdot 3\cdot 4 +
\frac{8\cdot4^4}{..}}}} \quad\quad,\quad\quad \frac{8}{7 \zeta(3)} = 1\cdot 1 -
\frac{1^6}{3\cdot 7 - \frac{2^6}{5\cdot 19 - \frac{3^6}{7\cdot 37 -
\frac{4^6}{..}}}} \end{equation*} We present two algorithms that proved useful
in finding conjectures: a Meet-In-The-Middle (MITM) algorithm and a Gradient
Descent (GD) tailored to the recurrent structure of continued fractions. Both
algorithms are based on matching numerical values and thus they conjecture
formulas without providing proofs and without requiring prior knowledge on any
underlying mathematical structure. This approach is especially attractive for
constants for which no mathematical structure is known, as it reverses the
conventional approach of sequential logic in formal proofs. Instead, our work
supports a different approach for research: algorithms utilizing numerical data
to unveil mathematical structures, thus trying to play the role of intuition of
great mathematicians of the past, providing leads to new mathematical research.",2019-06-29,2019,2019-06,chemistry
"Multiple-objective Reinforcement Learning for Inverse Design and
  Identification","The aim of the inverse chemical design is to develop new molecules with given
optimized molecular properties or objectives. Recently, generative deep
learning (DL) networks are considered as the state-of-the-art in inverse
chemical design and have achieved early success in generating molecular
structures with desired properties in the pharmaceutical and material chemistry
fields. However, satisfying a large number (larger than 10 objectives) of
molecular objectives is a limitation of current generative models. To improve
the model's ability to handle a large number of molecule design objectives, we
developed a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based generative framework to optimize
chemical molecule generation. Our use of Curriculum Learning (CL) to fine-tune
the pre-trained generative network allowed the model to satisfy up to 21
objectives and increase the generative network's robustness. The experiments
show that the proposed multiple-objective RL-based generative model can
correctly identify unknown molecules with an 83 to 100 percent success rate,
compared to the baseline approach of 0 percent. Additionally, this proposed
generative model is not limited to just chemistry research challenges; we
anticipate that problems that utilize RL with multiple-objectives will benefit
from this framework.",2019-10-09,2019,2019-10,chemistry
"DEFT-FUNNEL: an open-source global optimization solver for constrained
  grey-box and black-box problems","The fast-growing need for grey-box and black-box optimization methods for
constrained global optimization problems in fields such as medicine, chemistry,
engineering and artificial intelligence, has contributed for the design of new
efficient algorithms for finding the best possible solution. In this work, we
present DEFT-FUNNEL, an open-source global optimization algorithm for general
constrained grey-box and black-box problems that belongs to the class of
trust-region sequential quadratic optimization algorithms. It extends the
previous works by Sampaio and Toint (2015, 2016) to a global optimization
solver that is able to exploit information from closed-form functions.
Polynomial interpolation models are used as surrogates for the black-box
functions and a clustering-based multistart strategy is applied for searching
for the global minima. Numerical experiments show that DEFT-FUNNEL compares
favorably with other state-of-the-art methods on two sets of benchmark
problems: one set containing problems where every function is a black box and
another set with problems where some of the functions and their derivatives are
known to the solver. The code as well as the test sets used for experiments are

"Emo-CNN for Perceiving Stress from Audio Signals: A Brain Chemistry
  Approach","Emotion plays a key role in many applications like healthcare, to gather
patients emotional behavior. There are certain emotions which are given more
importance due to their effectiveness in understanding human feelings. In this
paper, we propose an approach that models human stress from audio signals. The
research challenge in speech emotion detection is defining the very meaning of
stress and being able to categorize it in a precise manner. Supervised Machine
Learning models, including state of the art Deep Learning classification
methods, rely on the availability of clean and labelled data. One of the
problems in affective computation and emotion detection is the limited amount
of annotated data of stress. The existing labelled stress emotion datasets are
highly subjective to the perception of the annotator.
  We address the first issue of feature selection by exploiting the use of
traditional MFCC features in Convolutional Neural Network. Our experiments show
that Emo-CNN consistently and significantly outperforms the popular existing
methods over multiple datasets. It achieves 90.2% categorical accuracy on the
Emo-DB dataset. To tackle the second and the more significant problem of
subjectivity in stress labels, we use Lovheim's cube, which is a 3-dimensional
projection of emotions. The cube aims at explaining the relationship between
these neurotransmitters and the positions of emotions in 3D space. The learnt
emotion representations from the Emo-CNN are mapped to the cube using three
component PCA (Principal Component Analysis) which is then used to model human
stress. This proposed approach not only circumvents the need for labelled
stress data but also complies with the psychological theory of emotions given
by Lovheim's cube. We believe that this work is the first step towards creating
a connection between Artificial Intelligence and the chemistry of human
emotions.",2020-01-08,2020,2020-01,chemistry

artificial life behaviour: replication, metabolism and death.
  The main conclusion of these experiments is that graph rewrites systems which
allow conflicting rewrites are better than those which don't, as concerns their
artificial life properties. This is in contradiction with the search for good

Higher-Order Explanations of Graph Neural Networks via Relevant Walks,"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a popular approach for predicting graph
structured data. As GNNs tightly entangle the input graph into the neural
network structure, common explainable AI approaches are not applicable. To a
large extent, GNNs have remained black-boxes for the user so far. In this
paper, we show that GNNs can in fact be naturally explained using higher-order
expansions, i.e. by identifying groups of edges that jointly contribute to the
prediction. Practically, we find that such explanations can be extracted using
a nested attribution scheme, where existing techniques such as layer-wise
relevance propagation (LRP) can be applied at each step. The output is a
collection of walks into the input graph that are relevant for the prediction.
Our novel explanation method, which we denote by GNN-LRP, is applicable to a
broad range of graph neural networks and lets us extract practically relevant
insights on sentiment analysis of text data, structure-property relationships

Retro*: Learning Retrosynthetic Planning with Neural Guided A* Search,"Retrosynthetic planning is a critical task in organic chemistry which
identifies a series of reactions that can lead to the synthesis of a target
product. The vast number of possible chemical transformations makes the size of
the search space very big, and retrosynthetic planning is challenging even for
experienced chemists. However, existing methods either require expensive return
estimation by rollout with high variance, or optimize for search speed rather
than the quality. In this paper, we propose Retro*, a neural-based A*-like
algorithm that finds high-quality synthetic routes efficiently. It maintains
the search as an AND-OR tree, and learns a neural search bias with off-policy
data. Then guided by this neural network, it performs best-first search
efficiently during new planning episodes. Experiments on benchmark USPTO

Machine learning for electronically excited states of molecules,"Electronically excited states of molecules are at the heart of

excited-state simulations but also how this branch of artificial intelligence
can be used to advance this exciting research field in all its aspects.
Discussed applications of machine learning for excited states include
excited-state dynamics simulations, static calculations of absorption spectra,
as well as many others. In order to put these studies into context, we discuss
the promises and pitfalls of the involved machine learning techniques. Since
the latter are mostly based on quantum chemistry calculations, we also provide

Toward the quantification of cognition,"The machinery of the human brain -- analog, probabilistic, embodied -- can be
characterized computationally, but what machinery confers what computational
powers? Any such system can be abstractly cast in terms of two computational
components: a finite state machine carrying out computational steps, whether
via currents, chemistry, or mechanics; plus a set of allowable memory
operations, typically formulated in terms of an information store that can be
read from and written to, whether via synaptic change, state transition, or
recurrent activity. Probing these mechanisms for their information content, we
can capture the difference in computational power that various systems are
capable of. Most human cognitive abilities, from perception to action to
memory, are shared with other species; we seek to characterize those (few)
capabilities that are ubiquitously present among humans and absent from other
species. Three realms of formidable constraints -- a) measurable human
cognitive abilities, b) measurable allometric anatomic brain characteristics,
and c) measurable features of specific automata and formal grammars --

Shannon Entropy Rate of Hidden Markov Processes,"Hidden Markov chains are widely applied statistical models of stochastic
processes, from fundamental physics and chemistry to finance, health, and
artificial intelligence. The hidden Markov processes they generate are
notoriously complicated, however, even if the chain is finite state: no finite
expression for their Shannon entropy rate exists, as the set of their
predictive features is generically infinite. As such, to date one cannot make
general statements about how random they are nor how structured. Here, we
address the first part of this challenge by showing how to efficiently and

"On Open and Strong-Scaling Tools for Atom Probe Crystallography:
  High-Throughput Methods for Indexing Crystal Structure and Orientation","Volumetric crystal structure indexing and orientation mapping are key data
processing steps for virtually any quantitative study of spatial correlations
between the local chemistry and the microstructure of a material. For electron
and X-ray diffraction methods it is possible to develop indexing tools which
compare measured and analytically computed patterns to decode the structure and
relative orientation within local regions of interest. Consequently, a number
of numerically efficient and automated software tools exist to solve the above
characterisation tasks.
  For atom probe tomography (APT) experiments, however, the strategy of making
comparisons between measured and analytically computed patterns is less robust
because many APT datasets may contain substantial noise. Given that general
enough predictive models for such noise remain elusive, crystallography tools
for APT face several limitations: Their robustness to noise, and therefore,
their capability to identify and distinguish different crystal structures and
orientation is limited. In addition, the tools are sequential and demand
substantial manual interaction. In combination, this makes robust uncertainty
quantifying with automated high-throughput studies of the latent
crystallographic information a difficult task with APT data.
  To improve the situation, we review the existent methods and discuss how they
link to those in the diffraction communities. With this we modify some of the
APT methods to yield more robust descriptors of the atomic arrangement. We
report how this enables the development of an open-source software tool for
strong-scaling and automated identifying of crystal structure and mapping
crystal orientation in nanocrystalline APT datasets with multiple phases.",2020-09-01,2020,2020-09,chemistry
"Testing the Quantitative Spacetime Hypothesis using Artificial Narrative

robustly represented, via a multiscale process, in terms of invariant concepts,

spacetime relationships for the events. This study contributes to an ongoing
application of the Semantic Spacetime Hypothesis, and demonstrates the
unsupervised analysis of narrative texts using inexpensive computational
methods without knowledge of linguistics. Data streams are parsed and
fractionated into small constituents, by multiscale interferometry, in the
manner of bioinformatic analysis. Fragments may then be recombined to construct
original sensory episodes---or form new narratives by a chemistry of
association and pattern reconstruction, based only on the four fundamental
spacetime relationships. There is a straightforward correspondence between
bioinformatic processes and this cognitive representation of natural language.

Information Obfuscation of Graph Neural Networks,"While the advent of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has greatly improved node

extract node-level information about sensitive attributes. In this paper, we
study the problem of protecting sensitive attributes by information obfuscation
when learning with graph structured data. We propose a framework to locally
filter out pre-determined sensitive attributes via adversarial training with
the total variation and the Wasserstein distance. Our method creates a strong
defense against inference attacks, while only suffering small loss in task
performance. Theoretically, we analyze the effectiveness of our framework
against a worst-case adversary, and characterize an inherent trade-off between
maximizing predictive accuracy and minimizing information leakage. Experiments
across multiple datasets from recommender systems, knowledge graphs and quantum
chemistry demonstrate that the proposed approach provides a robust defense

End-to-End Differentiable Molecular Mechanics Force Field Construction,"Molecular mechanics (MM) potentials have long been a workhorse of
computational chemistry. Leveraging accuracy and speed, these functional forms
find use in a wide variety of applications in biomolecular modeling and drug
discovery, from rapid virtual screening to detailed free energy calculations.
Traditionally, MM potentials have relied on human-curated, inflexible, and
poorly extensible discrete chemical perception rules or applying parameters to
small molecules or biopolymers, making it difficult to optimize both types and
parameters to fit quantum chemical or physical property data. Here, we propose
an alternative approach that uses graph neural networks to perceive chemical
environments, producing continuous atom embeddings from which valence and
nonbonded parameters can be predicted using invariance-preserving layers. Since
all stages are built from smooth neural functions, the entire process is
modular and end-to-end differentiable with respect to model parameters,
allowing new force fields to be easily constructed, extended, and applied to
arbitrary molecules. We show that this approach is not only sufficiently
expressive to reproduce legacy atom types, but that it can learn to accurately
reproduce and extend existing molecular mechanics force fields. Trained with
arbitrary loss functions, it can construct entirely new force fields
self-consistently applicable to both biopolymers and small molecules directly
from quantum chemical calculations, with superior fidelity than traditional
atom or parameter typing schemes. When trained on the same quantum chemical
small molecule dataset used to parameterize the openff-1.2.0 small molecule

we shift the focus on the insights and the knowledge obtained by the machine
learning models themselves. In particular, we study how it can be extracted and
used to inspire human scientists to increase their intuitions and understanding
of natural systems. We apply gradient boosting in decision trees to extract
human interpretable insights from big data sets from chemistry and physics. In
chemistry, we not only rediscover widely know rules of thumb but also find new
interesting motifs that tell us how to control solubility and energy levels of
organic molecules. At the same time, in quantum physics, we gain new
understanding on experiments for quantum entanglement. The ability to go beyond
numerics and to enter the realm of scientific insight and hypothesis generation
opens the door to use machine learning to accelerate the discovery of
conceptual understanding in some of the most challenging domains of science.",2020-10-27,2020,2020-10,chemistry
Social Chemistry 101: Learning to Reason about Social and Moral Norms,"Social norms -- the unspoken commonsense rules about acceptable social
behavior -- are crucial in understanding the underlying causes and intents of
people's actions in narratives. For example, underlying an action such as
""wanting to call cops on my neighbors"" are social norms that inform our
conduct, such as ""It is expected that you report crimes.""
  We present Social Chemistry, a new conceptual formalism to study people's
everyday social norms and moral judgments over a rich spectrum of real life
situations described in natural language. We introduce Social-Chem-101, a
large-scale corpus that catalogs 292k rules-of-thumb such as ""it is rude to run
a blender at 5am"" as the basic conceptual units. Each rule-of-thumb is further
broken down with 12 different dimensions of people's judgments, including
social judgments of good and bad, moral foundations, expected cultural
pressure, and assumed legality, which together amount to over 4.5 million
annotations of categorical labels and free-text descriptions.
  Comprehensive empirical results based on state-of-the-art neural models
demonstrate that computational modeling of social norms is a promising research
direction. Our model framework, Neural Norm Transformer, learns and generalizes
Social-Chem-101 to successfully reason about previously unseen situations,
generating relevant (and potentially novel) attribute-aware social
rules-of-thumb.",2020-11-01,2020,2020-11,chemistry

the impact of using different combinations of self-supervised tasks for

task(s) for pre-training has a significant impact on performance in subsequent
downstream tasks such as Virtual Screening. ii) Using auxiliary tasks with more
domain relevance for Chemistry, such as learning to predict calculated
molecular properties, increases the fidelity of our learnt representations.

"Data-driven equation for drug-membrane permeability across drugs and
  membranes","Drug efficacy depends on its capacity to permeate across the cell membrane.
We consider the prediction of passive drug-membrane permeability coefficients.
Beyond the widely recognized correlation with hydrophobicity, we additionally
consider the functional relationship between passive permeation and acidity. To
discover easily interpretable equations that explain the data well, we use the
recently proposed sure-independence screening and sparsifying operator (SISSO),
an artificial-intelligence technique that combines symbolic regression with
compressed sensing. Our study is based on a large in silico dataset of 0.4
million small molecules extracted from coarse-grained simulations. We
rationalize the equation suggested by SISSO via an analysis of the
inhomogeneous solubility-diffusion model in several asymptotic acidity regimes.
We further extend our analysis to the dependence on lipid-membrane composition.
Lipid-tail unsaturation plays a key role, but surprisingly contributes stepwise
rather than proportionally. Our results are in line with previously observed
changes in permeability, suggesting the distinction between liquid-disordered
(Ld) and liquid-ordered (Lo) permeation. Together, compressed sensing with
analytically derived asymptotes establish and validate an accurate, broadly
applicable, and interpretable equation for passive permeability across both
drug and lipid-tail chemistry.",2020-12-03,2020,2020-12,chemistry

Constraining chemical networks inAstrochemistry,"Databases of gas and surface chemical reactions are a key tool for scientists
working in a wide range of physical sciences. In Astrochemistry, databases of
chemical reactions are used as inputs to chemical models to determine the
abundances of the interstellar medium. Gas chemistry and, in particular, grain
surface chemistry and its treatment in gas-grain chemical models are however
areas of large uncertainty. Many reactions - especially on the dust grains -
have not been systematically experimentally studied. Moreover, experimental
measurements are often not easily translated to the rate equation approach most
commonly used in astrochemical modelling. Reducing the degree of uncertainty
intrinsic in these databases is therefore a prime problem, but has so far been
approached mainly by ad hoc procedures of essentially trial and error. In this
chapter we review the problem of the determination of accurate and complete
chemical networks in the wider context of Astrochemistry and explore the
possibility of using statistical methods and machine learning (ML) techniques
to reduce the uncertainty in chemical networks.",2021-01-13,2021,2021-01,chemistry
Noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) algorithms,"A universal fault-tolerant quantum computer that can solve efficiently

While the experimental advancement towards realizing such devices will
potentially take decades of research, noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)
computers already exist. These computers are composed of hundreds of noisy
qubits, i.e. qubits that are not error-corrected, and therefore perform
imperfect operations in a limited coherence time. In the search for quantum
advantage with these devices, algorithms have been proposed for applications in
various disciplines spanning physics, machine learning, quantum chemistry and
combinatorial optimization. The goal of such algorithms is to leverage the
limited available resources to perform classically challenging tasks. In this

Unassisted Noise Reduction of Chemical Reaction Data Sets,"Existing deep learning models applied to reaction prediction in organic
chemistry can reach high levels of accuracy (> 90% for Natural Language
Processing-based ones). With no chemical knowledge embedded than the
information learnt from reaction data, the quality of the data sets plays a
crucial role in the performance of the prediction models. While human curation
is prohibitively expensive, the need for unaided approaches to remove
chemically incorrect entries from existing data sets is essential to improve
artificial intelligence models' performance in synthetic chemistry tasks. Here
we propose a machine learning-based, unassisted approach to remove chemically
wrong entries from chemical reaction collections. We applied this method to the
collection of chemical reactions Pistachio and to an open data set, both
extracted from USPTO (United States Patent Office) patents. Our results show an
improved prediction quality for models trained on the cleaned and balanced data
sets. For the retrosynthetic models, the round-trip accuracy metric grows by 13
percentage points and the value of the cumulative Jensen Shannon divergence
decreases by 30% compared to its original record. The coverage remains high

Few-shot Conformal Prediction with Auxiliary Tasks,"We develop a novel approach to conformal prediction when the target task has
limited data available for training. Conformal prediction identifies a small
set of promising output candidates in place of a single prediction, with
guarantees that the set contains the correct answer with high probability. When
training data is limited, however, the predicted set can easily become unusably
large. In this work, we obtain substantially tighter prediction sets while
maintaining desirable marginal guarantees by casting conformal prediction as a
meta-learning paradigm over exchangeable collections of auxiliary tasks. Our
conformalization algorithm is simple, fast, and agnostic to the choice of
underlying model, learning algorithm, or dataset. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of this approach across a number of few-shot classification and

computational chemistry for drug discovery.",2021-02-17,2021,2021-02,chemistry
Full Page Handwriting Recognition via Image to Sequence Extraction,"We present a Neural Network based Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) model

"Graph Entropy Guided Node Embedding Dimension Selection for Graph Neural
  Networks","Graph representation learning has achieved great success in many areas,
including e-commerce, chemistry, biology, etc. However, the fundamental problem
of choosing the appropriate dimension of node embedding for a given graph still
remains unsolved. The commonly used strategies for Node Embedding Dimension
Selection (NEDS) based on grid search or empirical knowledge suffer from heavy
computation and poor model performance. In this paper, we revisit NEDS from the
perspective of minimum entropy principle. Subsequently, we propose a novel
Minimum Graph Entropy (MinGE) algorithm for NEDS with graph data. To be
specific, MinGE considers both feature entropy and structure entropy on graphs,
which are carefully designed according to the characteristics of the rich
information in them. The feature entropy, which assumes the embeddings of
adjacent nodes to be more similar, connects node features and link topology on
graphs. The structure entropy takes the normalized degree as basic unit to
further measure the higher-order structure of graphs. Based on them, we design
MinGE to directly calculate the ideal node embedding dimension for any graph.
Finally, comprehensive experiments with popular Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our
proposed MinGE.",2021-05-07,2021,2021-05,chemistry
Neural Error Mitigation of Near-Term Quantum Simulations,"Near-term quantum computers provide a promising platform for finding ground
states of quantum systems, which is an essential task in physics, chemistry,

effects of noise as well as the limited resources of near-term quantum
hardware. We introduce ""neural error mitigation,"" which uses neural networks to
improve estimates of ground states and ground-state observables obtained using
near-term quantum simulations. To demonstrate our method's broad applicability,
we employ neural error mitigation to find the ground states of the H$_2$ and
LiH molecular Hamiltonians, as well as the lattice Schwinger model, prepared
via the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). Our results show that neural
error mitigation improves numerical and experimental VQE computations to yield
low energy errors, high fidelities, and accurate estimations of more-complex
observables like order parameters and entanglement entropy, without requiring
additional quantum resources. Furthermore, neural error mitigation is agnostic
with respect to the quantum state preparation algorithm used, the quantum
hardware it is implemented on, and the particular noise channel affecting the
experiment, contributing to its versatility as a tool for quantum simulation.",2021-05-17,2021,2021-05,chemistry

vectorization. Then, our generalized natural gradient direction is simply the
inverse of the GFIM multiplies the gradient in the matrix form. Moreover, the
GFIM and its inverse keeps the same for multiple steps so that the
computational cost can be controlled and is comparable with the first-order
methods. A global convergence is established under some mild conditions and a
regret bound is also given for the online learning setting. Numerical results
on image classification with ResNet50, quantum chemistry modeling with Schnet,

illustrate that GN+ is competitive with the state-of-the-art methods.",2021-06-14,2021,2021-06,chemistry
"Total Nitrogen Estimation in Agricultural Soils via Aerial Multispectral
  Imaging and LIBS","Measuring soil health indicators is an important and challenging task that
affects farmers' decisions on timing, placement, and quantity of fertilizers
applied in the farms. Most existing methods to measure soil health indicators
(SHIs) are in-lab wet chemistry or spectroscopy-based methods, which require
significant human input and effort, time-consuming, costly, and are
low-throughput in nature. To address this challenge, we develop an artificial
intelligence (AI)-driven near real-time unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based
multispectral sensing (UMS) solution to estimate total nitrogen (TN) of the
soil, an important macro-nutrient or SHI that directly affects the crop health.
Accurate prediction of soil TN can significantly increase crop yield through
informed decision making on the timing of seed planting, and fertilizer
quantity and timing. We train two machine learning models including multi-layer
perceptron and support vector machine to predict the soil nitrogen using a
suite of data classes including multispectral characteristics of the soil and
crops in red, near-infrared, and green spectral bands, computed vegetation
indices, and environmental variables including air temperature and relative

"A Point Cloud-Based Deep Learning Strategy for Protein-Ligand Binding
  Affinity Prediction","There is great interest to develop artificial intelligence-based
protein-ligand affinity models due to their immense applications in drug
discovery. In this paper, PointNet and PointTransformer, two pointwise
multi-layer perceptrons have been applied for protein-ligand affinity
prediction for the first time. Three-dimensional point clouds could be rapidly
generated from the data sets in PDBbind-2016, which contain 3 772 and 11 327
individual point clouds derived from the refined or/and general sets,
respectively. These point clouds were used to train PointNet or
PointTransformer, resulting in protein-ligand affinity prediction models with
Pearson correlation coefficients R = 0.831 or 0.859 from the larger point
clouds respectively, based on the CASF-2016 benchmark test. The analysis of the
parameters suggests that the two deep learning models were capable to learn
many interactions between proteins and their ligands, and these key atoms for
the interaction could be visualized in point clouds. The protein-ligand
interaction features learned by PointTransformer could be further adapted for
the XGBoost-based machine learning algorithm, resulting in prediction models
with an average Rp of 0.831, which is on par with the state-of-the-art machine
learning models based on PDBbind database. These results suggest that point
clouds derived from the PDBbind datasets are useful to evaluate the performance
of 3D point clouds-centered deep learning algorithms, which could learn
critical protein-ligand interactions from natural evolution or medicinal

"From data to noise to data: mixing physics across temperatures with
  generative artificial intelligence","Using simulations or experiments performed at some set of temperatures to
learn about the physics or chemistry at some other arbitrary temperature is a
problem of immense practical and theoretical relevance. Here we develop a
framework based on statistical mechanics and generative Artificial Intelligence
that allows solving this problem. Specifically, we work with denoising
diffusion probabilistic models, and show how these models in combination with
replica exchange molecular dynamics achieve superior sampling of the
biomolecular energy landscape at temperatures that were never even simulated
without assuming any particular slow degrees of freedom. The key idea is to
treat the temperature as a fluctuating random variable and not a control
parameter as is usually done. This allows us to directly sample from the joint
probability distribution in configuration and temperature space. The results
here are demonstrated for a chirally symmetric peptide and single-strand
ribonucleic acid undergoing conformational transitions in all-atom water. We
demonstrate how we can discover transition states and metastable states that
were previously unseen at the temperature of interest, and even bypass the need
to perform further simulations for wide range of temperatures. At the same
time, any unphysical states are easily identifiable through very low Boltzmann
weights. The procedure while shown here for a class of molecular simulations
should be more generally applicable to mixing information across simulations
and experiments with varying control parameters.",2021-07-15,2021,2021-07,chemistry
"Learning Attributed Graph Representations with Communicative Message
  Passing Transformer","Constructing appropriate representations of molecules lies at the core of
numerous tasks such as material science, chemistry and drug designs. Recent
researches abstract molecules as attributed graphs and employ graph neural
networks (GNN) for molecular representation learning, which have made
remarkable achievements in molecular graph modeling. Albeit powerful, current
models either are based on local aggregation operations and thus miss
higher-order graph properties or focus on only node information without fully
using the edge information. For this sake, we propose a Communicative Message
Passing Transformer (CoMPT) neural network to improve the molecular graph
representation by reinforcing message interactions between nodes and edges
based on the Transformer architecture. Unlike the previous transformer-style
GNNs that treat molecules as fully connected graphs, we introduce a message
diffusion mechanism to leverage the graph connectivity inductive bias and
reduce the message enrichment explosion. Extensive experiments demonstrated
that the proposed model obtained superior performances (around 4$\%$ on
average) against state-of-the-art baselines on seven chemical property datasets

"Multiple Query Optimization using a Hybrid Approach of Classical and

overcome errors introduced by today's quantum computers, hybrid algorithms

multiple query optimization problem (MQO) which is an important NP-hard problem
in the area of data-intensive problems. We propose a novel hybrid
classical-quantum algorithm to solve the MQO on a gate-based quantum computer.
We perform a detailed experimental evaluation of our algorithm and compare its
performance against a competing approach that employs a quantum annealer --
another type of quantum computer. Our experimental results demonstrate that our
algorithm currently can only handle small problem sizes due to the limited
number of qubits available on a gate-based quantum computer compared to a
quantum computer based on quantum annealing. However, our algorithm shows a
qubit efficiency of close to 99% which is almost a factor of 2 higher compared
to the state of the art implementation. Finally, we analyze how our algorithm
scales with larger problem sizes and conclude that our approach shows promising
results for near-term quantum computers.",2021-07-22,2021,2021-07,chemistry

"IGNNITION: Bridging the Gap Between Graph Neural Networks and Networking
  Systems","Recent years have seen the vast potential of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) in
many fields where data is structured as graphs (e.g., chemistry, recommender
systems). In particular, GNNs are becoming increasingly popular in the field of
networking, as graphs are intrinsically present at many levels (e.g., topology,

networks unseen during training, which is an essential feature for developing
practical Machine Learning (ML) solutions for networking. However, implementing
a functional GNN prototype is currently a cumbersome task that requires strong
skills in neural network programming. This poses an important barrier to
network engineers that often do not have the necessary ML expertise. In this
article, we present IGNNITION, a novel open-source framework that enables fast
prototyping of GNNs for networking systems. IGNNITION is based on an intuitive
high-level abstraction that hides the complexity behind GNNs, while still
offering great flexibility to build custom GNN architectures. To showcase the

cognitive abilities in humans, but only marginally addresses biologically
plausible approaches based on natural computation. This mini review presents a
set of perspectives and approaches which have shaped the development of
biologically inspired computational models in the recent past that can lead to
the development of biologically more realistic cognitive architectures. For
describing continuum of natural cognitive architectures, from basal cellular to
human-level cognition, we use evolutionary info-computational framework, where
natural/ physical/ morphological computation leads to evolution of increasingly

theory, self-organization, theory of evolution, information and computation.
Novel developments support a constructive interdisciplinary framework for
cognitive architectures in the context of computing nature, where interactions
between constituents at different levels of organization lead to
complexification of agency and increased cognitive capacities. We identify
several important research questions for further investigation that can
increase understanding of cognition in nature and inspire new developments of

"A Deep Dive into Machine Learning Density Functional Theory for
  Materials Science and Chemistry","With the growth of computational resources, the scope of electronic structure
simulations has increased greatly. Artificial intelligence and robust data
analysis hold the promise to accelerate large-scale simulations and their
analysis to hitherto unattainable scales. Machine learning is a rapidly growing
field for the processing of such complex datasets. It has recently gained
traction in the domain of electronic structure simulations, where density
functional theory takes the prominent role of the most widely used electronic

equivariant non-linear convolutions, which further allows us to pin-point the
successful components of SEGNNs: non-linear message aggregation improves upon
classic linear (steerable) point convolutions; steerable messages improve upon

this paper, we observe that AI expertise requires integrating computational,
conceptual, and mathematical knowledge and representations. We call this the
``AI triplet,'' similar in spirit to the ``chemistry triplet'' that has heavily
influenced the past four decades of chemistry education research. We describe a
theoretical foundation for this triplet and show how it maps onto two sample AI
topics: tree search and gradient descent. Finally, just as the chemistry
triplet has impacted chemistry education in concrete ways, we suggest two
initial hypotheses for how the AI triplet might impact AI education: 1) how we
can help AI students gain proficiency in moving between the corners of the
triplet; and 2) how all corners of the AI triplet highlight the need for
supporting students' spatial cognitive skills.",2021-10-14,2021,2021-10,chemistry
Geometric Transformer for End-to-End Molecule Properties Prediction,"Transformers have become methods of choice in many applications thanks to
their ability to represent complex interactions between elements. However,
extending the Transformer architecture to non-sequential data such as molecules
and enabling its training on small datasets remains a challenge. In this work,
we introduce a Transformer-based architecture for molecule property prediction,
which is able to capture the geometry of the molecule. We modify the classical
positional encoder by an initial encoding of the molecule geometry, as well as
a learned gated self-attention mechanism. We further suggest an augmentation
scheme for molecular data capable of avoiding the overfitting induced by the
overparameterized architecture. The proposed framework outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods while being based on pure machine learning solely,
i.e. the method does not incorporate domain knowledge from quantum chemistry
and does not use extended geometric inputs besides the pairwise atomic
distances.",2021-10-26,2021,2021-10,chemistry
"Scientific Discovery and the Cost of Measurement -- Balancing
  Information and Cost in Reinforcement Learning","The use of reinforcement learning (RL) in scientific applications, such as
materials design and automated chemistry, is increasing. A major challenge,
however, lies in fact that measuring the state of the system is often costly
and time consuming in scientific applications, whereas policy learning with RL
requires a measurement after each time step. In this work, we make the
measurement costs explicit in the form of a costed reward and propose a
framework that enables off-the-shelf deep RL algorithms to learn a policy for
both selecting actions and determining whether or not to measure the current
state of the system at each time step. In this way, the agents learn to balance
the need for information with the cost of information. Our results show that
when trained under this regime, the Dueling DQN and PPO agents can learn
optimal action policies whilst making up to 50\% fewer state measurements, and
recurrent neural networks can produce a greater than 50\% reduction in
measurements. We postulate the these reduction can help to lower the barrier to
applying RL to real-world scientific applications.",2021-12-14,2021,2021-12,chemistry
"Beyond Low Earth Orbit: Biomonitoring, Artificial Intelligence, and
  Precision Space Health","Human space exploration beyond low Earth orbit will involve missions of
significant distance and duration. To effectively mitigate myriad space health
hazards, paradigm shifts in data and space health systems are necessary to
enable Earth-independence, rather than Earth-reliance. Promising developments
in the fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning for biology and
health can address these needs. We propose an appropriately autonomous and
intelligent Precision Space Health system that will monitor, aggregate, and
assess biomedical statuses; analyze and predict personalized adverse health
outcomes; adapt and respond to newly accumulated data; and provide preventive,
actionable, and timely insights to individual deep space crew members and
iterative decision support to their crew medical officer. Here we present a
summary of recommendations from a workshop organized by the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, on future applications of artificial
intelligence in space biology and health. In the next decade, biomonitoring
technology, biomarker science, spacecraft hardware, intelligent software, and
streamlined data management must mature and be woven together into a Precision

and model organisms from both spaceborne and ground-analog studies. As research
is extended beyond low Earth orbit, experiments and platforms must be maximally
autonomous, light, agile, and intelligent to expedite knowledge discovery. Here
we present a summary of recommendations from a workshop organized by the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration on artificial intelligence,

"AlphaFold Accelerates Artificial Intelligence Powered Drug Discovery:
  Efficient Discovery of a Novel Cyclin-dependent Kinase 20 (CDK20) Small
  Molecule Inhibitor","The AlphaFold computer program predicted protein structures for the whole
human genome, which has been considered as a remarkable breakthrough both in
artificial intelligence (AI) application and structural biology. Despite the
varying confidence level, these predicted structures still could significantly
contribute to structure-based drug design of novel targets, especially the ones
with no or limited structural information. In this work, we successfully
applied AlphaFold in our end-to-end AI-powered drug discovery engines
constituted of a biocomputational platform PandaOmics and a generative
chemistry platform Chemistry42, to identify a first-in-class hit molecule of a
novel target without an experimental structure starting from target selection
towards hit identification in a cost- and time-efficient manner. PandaOmics
provided the targets of interest and Chemistry42 generated the molecules based
on the AlphaFold predicted structure, and the selected molecules were
synthesized and tested in biological assays. Through this approach, we
identified a small molecule hit compound for CDK20 with a Kd value of 8.9 +/-
1.6 uM (n = 4) within 30 days from target selection and after only synthesizing
7 compounds. Based on the available data, the second round of AI-powered
compound generation was conducted and through which, a more potent hit
molecule, ISM042-2 048, was discovered with a Kd value of 210.0 +/- 42.4 nM (n
= 2), within 30 days and after synthesizing 6 compounds from the discovery of
the first hit ISM042-2-001. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
reported small molecule targeting CDK20 and more importantly, this work is the
first demonstration of AlphaFold application in the hit identification process
in early drug discovery.",2022-01-21,2022,2022-01,chemistry
"DrugOOD: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Dataset Curator and Benchmark for
  AI-aided Drug Discovery -- A Focus on Affinity Prediction Problems with Noise
  Annotations","AI-aided drug discovery (AIDD) is gaining increasing popularity due to its
promise of making the search for new pharmaceuticals quicker, cheaper and more
efficient. In spite of its extensive use in many fields, such as ADMET
prediction, virtual screening, protein folding and generative chemistry, little
has been explored in terms of the out-of-distribution (OOD) learning problem
with \emph{noise}, which is inevitable in real world AIDD applications.
  In this work, we present DrugOOD, a systematic OOD dataset curator and
benchmark for AI-aided drug discovery, which comes with an open-source Python
package that fully automates the data curation and OOD benchmarking processes.
We focus on one of the most crucial problems in AIDD: drug target binding
affinity prediction, which involves both macromolecule (protein target) and
small-molecule (drug compound). In contrast to only providing fixed datasets,
DrugOOD offers automated dataset curator with user-friendly customization
scripts, rich domain annotations aligned with biochemistry knowledge, realistic
noise annotations and rigorous benchmarking of state-of-the-art OOD algorithms.
Since the molecular data is often modeled as irregular graphs using graph
neural network (GNN) backbones, DrugOOD also serves as a valuable testbed for
\emph{graph OOD learning} problems. Extensive empirical studies have shown a
significant performance gap between in-distribution and out-of-distribution
experiments, which highlights the need to develop better schemes that can allow
for OOD generalization under noise for AIDD.",2022-01-24,2022,2022-01,chemistry

necessity has emerged to analyse how molecular property variation is modulated
by either single atoms or chemical groups. In this paper, we propose to train
graph-to-graph neural network using semi-supervised learning for attributing
structure-property relationships. As initial case studies we apply the method
to solubility and molecular acidity while checking its consistency in
comparison with known experimental chemical data. As final goal, our approach

"MolNet: A Chemically Intuitive Graph Neural Network for Prediction of
  Molecular Properties","The graph neural network (GNN) has been a powerful deep-learning tool in
chemistry domain, due to its close connection with molecular graphs. Most GNN
models collect and update atom and molecule features from the fed atom (and, in
some cases, bond) features, which are basically based on the two-dimensional
(2D) graph representation of 3D molecules. Correspondingly, the adjacency
matrix, containing the information on covalent bonds, or equivalent data
structures (e.g., lists) have been the main core in the feature-updating
processes, such as graph convolution. However, the 2D-based models do not
faithfully represent 3D molecules and their physicochemical properties,
exemplified by the overlooked field effect that is a ""through-space"" effect,
not a ""through-bond"" effect. The GNN model proposed herein, denoted as MolNet,
is chemically intuitive, accommodating the 3D non-bond information in a
molecule, with a noncovalent adjacency matrix $\bf{\bar A}$, and also
bond-strength information from a weighted bond matrix $\bf{B}$. The noncovalent
atoms, not directly bonded to a given atom in a molecule, are identified within
5 $\unicode{x212B}$ of cut-off range for the construction of $\bf{\bar A}$, and
$\bf{B}$ has edge weights of 1, 1.5, 2, and 3 for single, aromatic, double, and
triple bonds, respectively. Comparative studies show that MolNet outperforms
various baseline GNN models and gives a state-of-the-art performance in the
classification task of BACE dataset and regression task of ESOL dataset. This
work suggests a future direction of deep-learning chemistry in the construction
of deep-learning models that are chemically intuitive and comparable with the
existing chemistry concepts and tools.",2022-02-01,2022,2022-02,chemistry
Target-aware Molecular Graph Generation,"Generating molecules with desired biological activities has attracted growing
attention in drug discovery. Previous molecular generation models are designed
as chemocentric methods that hardly consider the drug-target interaction,
limiting their practical applications. In this paper, we aim to generate
molecular drugs in a target-aware manner that bridges biological activity and
molecular design. To solve this problem, we compile a benchmark dataset from
several publicly available datasets and build baselines in a unified framework.
Building on the recent advantages of flow-based molecular generation models, we
propose SiamFlow, which forces the flow to fit the distribution of target
sequence embeddings in latent space. Specifically, we employ an alignment loss
and a uniform loss to bring target sequence embeddings and drug graph
embeddings into agreements while avoiding collapse. Furthermore, we formulate
the alignment into a one-to-many problem by learning spaces of target sequence
embeddings. Experiments quantitatively show that our proposed method learns
meaningful representations in the latent space toward the target-aware
molecular graph generation and provides an alternative approach to bridge
biology and chemistry in drug discovery.",2022-02-10,2022,2022-02,chemistry
ChemicalX: A Deep Learning Library for Drug Pair Scoring,"In this paper, we introduce ChemicalX, a PyTorch-based deep learning library

pair scoring models accessible to machine learning researchers and
practitioners in a streamlined framework.The design of ChemicalX reuses
existing high level model training utilities, geometric deep learning, and deep
chemistry layers from the PyTorch ecosystem. Our system provides neural network
layers, custom pair scoring architectures, data loaders, and batch iterators
for end users. We showcase these features with example code snippets and case
studies to highlight the characteristics of ChemicalX. A range of experiments
on real world drug-drug interaction, polypharmacy side effect, and combination
synergy prediction tasks demonstrate that the models available in ChemicalX are
effective at solving the pair scoring task. Finally, we show that ChemicalX
could be used to train and score machine learning models on large drug pair
datasets with hundreds of thousands of compounds on commodity hardware.",2022-02-10,2022,2022-02,chemistry
"Improving Molecular Representation Learning with Metric
  Learning-enhanced Optimal Transport","Training data are usually limited or heterogeneous in many chemical and
biological applications. Existing machine learning models for chemistry and
materials science fail to consider generalizing beyond training domains. In
this article, we develop a novel optimal transport-based algorithm termed MROT
to enhance their generalization capability for molecular regression problems.
MROT learns a continuous label of the data by measuring a new metric of domain
distances and a posterior variance regularization over the transport plan to
bridge the chemical domain gap. Among downstream tasks, we consider basic
chemical regression tasks in unsupervised and semi-supervised settings,
including chemical property prediction and materials adsorption selection.
Extensive experiments show that MROT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
models, showing promising potential in accelerating the discovery of new
substances with desired properties.",2022-02-13,2022,2022-02,chemistry

SELFIES and the future of molecular string representations,"Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are expanding in
popularity for broad applications to challenging tasks in chemistry and
materials science. Examples include the prediction of properties, the discovery
of new reaction pathways, or the design of new molecules. The machine needs to
read and write fluently in a chemical language for each of these tasks. Strings
are a common tool to represent molecular graphs, and the most popular molecular
string representation, SMILES, has powered cheminformatics since the late
1980s. However, in the context of AI and ML in chemistry, SMILES has several
shortcomings -- most pertinently, most combinations of symbols lead to invalid
results with no valid chemical interpretation. To overcome this issue, a new
language for molecules was introduced in 2020 that guarantees 100\% robustness:
SELFIES (SELF-referencIng Embedded Strings). SELFIES has since simplified and
enabled numerous new applications in chemistry. In this manuscript, we look to
the future and discuss molecular string representations, along with their
respective opportunities and challenges. We propose 16 concrete Future Projects
for robust molecular representations. These involve the extension toward new
chemical domains, exciting questions at the interface of AI and robust
languages and interpretability for both humans and machines. We hope that these
proposals will inspire several follow-up works exploiting the full potential of
molecular string representations for the future of AI in chemistry and
materials science.",2022-03-31,2022,2022-03,chemistry
Translation between Molecules and Natural Language,"We present $\textbf{MolT5}$ $-$ a self-supervised learning framework for
pretraining models on a vast amount of unlabeled natural language text and
molecule strings. $\textbf{MolT5}$ allows for new, useful, and challenging
analogs of traditional vision-language tasks, such as molecule captioning and
text-based de novo molecule generation (altogether: translation between
molecules and language), which we explore for the first time. Since
$\textbf{MolT5}$ pretrains models on single-modal data, it helps overcome the
chemistry domain shortcoming of data scarcity. Furthermore, we consider several
metrics, including a new cross-modal embedding-based metric, to evaluate the
tasks of molecule captioning and text-based molecule generation. Our results
show that $\textbf{MolT5}$-based models are able to generate outputs, both
molecules and captions, which in many cases are high quality.",2022-04-25,2022,2022-04,chemistry
"Crystal Transformer: Self-learning neural language model for Generative
  and Tinkering Design of Materials","Self-supervised neural language models have recently achieved unprecedented
success, from natural language processing to learning the languages of
biological sequences and organic molecules. These models have demonstrated
superior performance in the generation, structure classification, and
functional predictions for proteins and molecules with learned representations.
However, most of the masking-based pre-trained language models are not designed
for generative design, and their black-box nature makes it difficult to
interpret their design logic. Here we propose BLMM Crystal Transformer, a
neural network based probabilistic generative model for generative and
tinkering design of inorganic materials. Our model is built on the blank
filling language model for text generation and has demonstrated unique
advantages in learning the ""materials grammars"" together with high-quality
generation, interpretability, and data efficiency. It can generate chemically
valid materials compositions with as high as 89.7\% charge neutrality and
84.8\% balanced electronegativity, which are more than 4 and 8 times higher
compared to a pseudo random sampling baseline. The probabilistic generation
process of BLMM allows it to recommend tinkering operations based on learned
materials chemistry and makes it useful for materials doping. Combined with the
TCSP crysal structure prediction algorithm, We have applied our model to
discover a set of new materials as validated using DFT calculations. Our work
thus brings the unsupervised transformer language models based generative
artificial intelligence to inorganic materials. A user-friendly web app has
been developed for computational materials doping and can be accessed freely at

"Multimodal Transformer-based Model for Buchwald-Hartwig and
  Suzuki-Miyaura Reaction Yield Prediction","Predicting the yield percentage of a chemical reaction is useful in many
aspects such as reducing wet-lab experimentation by giving the priority to the
reactions with a high predicted yield. In this work we investigated the use of
multiple type inputs to predict chemical reaction yield. We used simplified
molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) as well as calculated chemical
descriptors as model inputs. The model consists of a pre-trained bidirectional
transformer-based encoder (BERT) and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with a
regression head to predict the yield. We experimented on two high throughput
experimentation (HTE) datasets for Buchwald-Hartwig and Suzuki-Miyaura
reactions. The experiments show improvements in the prediction on both datasets
compared to systems using only SMILES or chemical descriptors as input. We also
tested the model's performance on out-of-sample dataset splits of
Buchwald-Hartwig and achieved comparable results with the state-of-the-art. In
addition to predicting the yield, we demonstrated the model's ability to
suggest the optimum (highest yield) reaction conditions. The model was able to
suggest conditions that achieves 94% of the optimum reported yields. This
proves the model to be useful in achieving the best results in the wet lab
without expensive experimentation.",2022-04-27,2022,2022-04,chemistry
FAIR data enabling new horizons for materials research,"The prosperity and lifestyle of our society are very much governed by
achievements in condensed matter physics, chemistry and materials science,
because new products for sectors such as energy, the environment, health,
mobility and information technology (IT) rely largely on improved or even new
materials. Examples include solid-state lighting, touchscreens, batteries,
implants, drug delivery and many more. The enormous amount of research data
produced every day in these fields represents a gold mine of the twenty-first
century. This gold mine is, however, of little value if these data are not
comprehensively characterized and made available. How can we refine this
feedstock; that is, turn data into knowledge and value? For this, a FAIR
(findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) data infrastructure is a
must. Only then can data be readily shared and explored using data analytics
and artificial intelligence (AI) methods. Making data 'findable and AI ready'
(a forward-looking interpretation of the acronym) will change the way in which

Power and limitations of single-qubit native quantum neural networks,"Quantum neural networks (QNNs) have emerged as a leading strategy to
establish applications in machine learning, chemistry, and optimization. While
the applications of QNN have been widely investigated, its theoretical
foundation remains less understood. In this paper, we formulate a theoretical
framework for the expressive ability of data re-uploading quantum neural
networks that consist of interleaved encoding circuit blocks and trainable
circuit blocks. First, we prove that single-qubit quantum neural networks can
approximate any univariate function by mapping the model to a partial Fourier
series. We in particular establish the exact correlations between the
parameters of the trainable gates and the Fourier coefficients, resolving an
open problem on the universal approximation property of QNN. Second, we discuss
the limitations of single-qubit native QNNs on approximating multivariate
functions by analyzing the frequency spectrum and the flexibility of Fourier
coefficients. We further demonstrate the expressivity and limitations of
single-qubit native QNNs via numerical experiments. We believe these results
would improve our understanding of QNNs and provide a helpful guideline for
designing powerful QNNs for machine learning tasks.",2022-05-16,2022,2022-05,chemistry
"Overview of STEM Science as Process, Method, Material, and Data Named

large-scale structured dataset of STEM articles across 10 different
disciplines, viz. Agriculture, Astronomy, Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science,
Earth Science, Engineering, Material Science, Mathematics, and Medicine. Our
analysis is defined over a large-scale corpus comprising 60K abstracts

Thus our study presents, for the first-time, an analysis of a large-scale

"Machine vision for vial positioning detection toward the safe automation
  of material synthesis","Although robot-based automation in chemistry laboratories can accelerate the
material development process, surveillance-free environments may lead to
dangerous accidents primarily due to machine control errors. Object detection
techniques can play vital roles in addressing these safety issues; however,
state-of-the-art detectors, including single-shot detector (SSD) models, suffer
from insufficient accuracy in environments involving complex and noisy scenes.
With the aim of improving safety in a surveillance-free laboratory, we report a
novel deep learning (DL)-based object detector, namely, DenseSSD. For the
foremost and frequent problem of detecting vial positions, DenseSSD achieved a
mean average precision (mAP) over 95% based on a complex dataset involving both
empty and solution-filled vials, greatly exceeding those of conventional
detectors; such high precision is critical to minimizing failure-induced
accidents. Additionally, DenseSSD was observed to be highly insensitive to the
environmental changes, maintaining its high precision under the variations of
solution colors or testing view angles. The robustness of DenseSSD would allow
the utilized equipment settings to be more flexible. This work demonstrates
that DenseSSD is useful for enhancing safety in an automated material synthesis
environment, and it can be extended to various applications where high
detection accuracy and speed are both needed.",2022-06-15,2022,2022-06,chemistry
Approximate Equivariance SO(3) Needlet Convolution,"This paper develops a rotation-invariant needlet convolution for rotation
group SO(3) to distill multiscale information of spherical signals. The
spherical needlet transform is generalized from $\mathbb{S}^2$ onto the SO(3)
group, which decomposes a spherical signal to approximate and detailed spectral
coefficients by a set of tight framelet operators. The spherical signal during
the decomposition and reconstruction achieves rotation invariance. Based on
needlet transforms, we form a Needlet approximate Equivariance Spherical CNN
(NES) with multiple SO(3) needlet convolutional layers. The network establishes
a powerful tool to extract geometric-invariant features of spherical signals.
The model allows sufficient network scalability with multi-resolution
representation. A robust signal embedding is learned with wavelet shrinkage
activation function, which filters out redundant high-pass representation while
maintaining approximate rotation invariance. The NES achieves state-of-the-art
performance for quantum chemistry regression and Cosmic Microwave Background
(CMB) delensing reconstruction, which shows great potential for solving
scientific challenges with high-resolution and multi-scale spherical signal

RetroGraph: Retrosynthetic Planning with Graph Search,"Retrosynthetic planning, which aims to find a reaction pathway to synthesize
a target molecule, plays an important role in chemistry and drug discovery.
This task is usually modeled as a search problem. Recently, data-driven methods
have attracted many research interests and shown promising results for
retrosynthetic planning. We observe that the same intermediate molecules are
visited many times in the searching process, and they are usually independently
treated in previous tree-based methods (e.g., AND-OR tree search, Monte Carlo
tree search). Such redundancies make the search process inefficient. We propose
a graph-based search policy that eliminates the redundant explorations of any
intermediate molecules. As searching over a graph is more complicated than over
a tree, we further adopt a graph neural network to guide the search over
graphs. Meanwhile, our method can search a batch of targets together in the
graph and remove the inter-target duplication in the tree-based search methods.
Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method. Especially on the widely used USPTO benchmark, we improve the search
success rate to 99.47%, advancing previous state-of-the-art performance for 2.6
points.",2022-06-23,2022,2022-06,chemistry
Solving Quantitative Reasoning Problems with Language Models,"Language models have achieved remarkable performance on a wide range of tasks
that require natural language understanding. Nevertheless, state-of-the-art

such as solving mathematics, science, and engineering problems at the college
level. To help close this gap, we introduce Minerva, a large language model
pretrained on general natural language data and further trained on technical
content. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on technical
benchmarks without the use of external tools. We also evaluate our model on
over two hundred undergraduate-level problems in physics, biology, chemistry,

We propose a hybrid, flexible surrogate model that exploits known physics for
simulating large-scale dynamics and limits learning to the hard-to-model term,
which is called parametrization or closure and captures the effect of fine-
onto large-scale dynamics. Leveraging neural operators, we are the first to

a much more complex chemical design space, and the development of accurate
molecular modeling frameworks. A holistic study of the growing chemistry
literature is, therefore, required that focuses on understanding the recent
trends and extrapolating them into possible future trajectories. To this end,
several network theory-based studies have been reported that use a directed
graph representation of chemical reactions. Here, we perform a study based on
representing chemical reactions as hypergraphs where the hyperedges represent
chemical reactions and nodes represent the participating molecules. We use a
standard reactions dataset to construct a hypernetwork and report its
statistics such as degree distributions, average path length, assortativity or
degree correlations, PageRank centrality, and graph-based clusters (or
communities). We also compute each statistic for an equivalent directed graph
representation of reactions to draw parallels and highlight differences between
the two. To demonstrate the AI applicability of hypergraph reaction
representation, we generate dense hypergraph embeddings and use them in the
reaction classification problem. We conclude that the hypernetwork
representation is flexible, preserves reaction context, and uncovers hidden

  a Few Trails","Artificial intelligence has deeply revolutionized the field of medicinal
chemistry with many impressive applications, but the success of these
applications requires a massive amount of training samples with high-quality
annotations, which seriously limits the wide usage of data-driven methods. In
this paper, we focus on the reaction yield prediction problem, which assists
chemists in selecting high-yield reactions in a new chemical space only with a
few experimental trials. To attack this challenge, we first put forth MetaRF,
an attention-based differentiable random forest model specially designed for
the few-shot yield prediction, where the attention weight of a random forest is
automatically optimized by the meta-learning framework and can be quickly
adapted to predict the performance of new reagents while given a few additional
samples. To improve the few-shot learning performance, we further introduce a
dimension-reduction based sampling method to determine valuable samples to be
experimentally tested and then learned. Our methodology is evaluated on three
different datasets and acquires satisfactory performance on few-shot
prediction. In high-throughput experimentation (HTE) datasets, the average
yield of our methodology's top 10 high-yield reactions is relatively close to
the results of ideal yield selection.",2022-08-22,2022,2022-08,chemistry
"A Molecular Multimodal Foundation Model Associating Molecule Graphs with
  Natural Language","Although artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant progress in
understanding molecules in a wide range of fields, existing models generally
acquire the single cognitive ability from the single molecular modality. Since
the hierarchy of molecular knowledge is profound, even humans learn from
different modalities including both intuitive diagrams and professional texts
to assist their understanding. Inspired by this, we propose a molecular
multimodal foundation model which is pretrained from molecular graphs and their
semantically related textual data (crawled from published Scientific Citation
Index papers) via contrastive learning. This AI model represents a critical
attempt that directly bridges molecular graphs and natural language.
Importantly, through capturing the specific and complementary information of
the two modalities, our proposed model can better grasp molecular expertise.
Experimental results show that our model not only exhibits promising
performance in cross-modal tasks such as cross-modal retrieval and molecule
caption, but also enhances molecular property prediction and possesses
capability to generate meaningful molecular graphs from natural language
descriptions. We believe that our model would have a broad impact on
AI-empowered fields across disciplines such as biology, chemistry, materials,
environment, and medicine, among others.",2022-09-12,2022,2022-09,chemistry
"Tartarus: A Benchmarking Platform for Realistic And Practical Inverse
  Molecular Design","The efficient exploration of chemical space to design molecules with intended
properties enables the accelerated discovery of drugs, materials, and
catalysts, and is one of the most important outstanding challenges in
chemistry. Encouraged by the recent surge in computer power and artificial
intelligence development, many algorithms have been developed to tackle this
problem. However, despite the emergence of many new approaches in recent years,
comparatively little progress has been made in developing realistic benchmarks
that reflect the complexity of molecular design for real-world applications. In
this work, we develop a set of practical benchmark tasks relying on physical
simulation of molecular systems mimicking real-life molecular design problems
for materials, drugs, and chemical reactions. Additionally, we demonstrate the
utility and ease of use of our new benchmark set by demonstrating how to
compare the performance of several well-established families of algorithms.
Surprisingly, we find that model performance can strongly depend on the
benchmark domain. We believe that our benchmark suite will help move the field
towards more realistic molecular design benchmarks, and move the development of
inverse molecular design algorithms closer to designing molecules that solve
existing problems in both academia and industry alike.",2022-09-26,2022,2022-09,chemistry
"Provenance of Lyfe: Chemical Autonomous Agents Surviving through
  Associative Learning","We present a benchmark study of autonomous, chemical agents exhibiting
associative learning of an environmental feature. Associative learning has been
widely studied in cognitive science and artificial intelligence, but are most
commonly implemented in highly complex or carefully engineered systems such as
animal brains, artificial neural networks, DNA computing systems and gene
regulatory networks. The ability to encode environmental correlations and use
them to make predictions is a benchmark of biological resilience, and underpins
a plethora of adaptive responses in the living hierarchy, spanning prey animal
species anticipating the arrival of predators, to epigenetic systems in
microorganisms learning environmental correlations. Given the ubiquitous and
essential presence of learning behaviours in the biosphere, we aimed to explore
whether simple, non-living dissipative structures could also exhibit
associative learning. Inspired by previous modeling of associative learning in
chemical networks, we simulated simple systems composed of long and short term
memory chemical species that could encode the presence or absence of temporal
correlations between two external species. The ability to learn this
association was implemented in Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion spots, emergent
chemical patterns that exhibit self-replication and homeostasis. With the novel
ability of associative learning, we demonstrate that simple chemical patterns
can exhibit a broad repertoire of life-like behaviour, paving the way for in
vitro studies of autonomous chemical learning systems, with potential relevance
to artificial life, origins of life, and systems chemistry. The experimental
realisation of these learning behaviours in protocell systems could advance a
novel research direction in astrobiology, since our system significantly
reduces the lower bound on the required complexity for emergent learning.",2022-10-11,2022,2022-10,chemistry
Perspectives for self-driving labs in synthetic biology,"Self-driving labs (SDLs) combine fully automated experiments with artificial

ultimate expression, SDLs could usher a new paradigm of scientific research,
where the world is probed, interpreted, and explained by machines for human
benefit. While there are functioning SDLs in the fields of chemistry and
materials science, we contend that synthetic biology provides a unique
opportunity since the genome provides a single target for affecting the
incredibly wide repertoire of biological cell behavior. However, the level of
investment required for the creation of biological SDLs is only warranted if
directed towards solving difficult and enabling biological questions. Here, we
discuss challenges and opportunities in creating SDLs for synthetic biology.",2022-10-14,2022,2022-10,chemistry
"PEMP: Leveraging Physics Properties to Enhance Molecular Property
  Prediction","Molecular property prediction is essential for drug discovery. In recent
years, deep learning methods have been introduced to this area and achieved
state-of-the-art performances. However, most of existing methods ignore the
intrinsic relations between molecular properties which can be utilized to
improve the performances of corresponding prediction tasks. In this paper, we
propose a new approach, namely Physics properties Enhanced Molecular Property
prediction (PEMP), to utilize relations between molecular properties revealed
by previous physics theory and physical chemistry studies. Specifically, we
enhance the training of the chemical and physiological property predictors with
related physics property prediction tasks. We design two different methods for
PEMP, respectively based on multi-task learning and transfer learning. Both
methods include a model-agnostic molecule representation module and a property
prediction module. In our implementation, we adopt both the state-of-the-art
molecule embedding models under the supervised learning paradigm and the
pretraining paradigm as the molecule representation module of PEMP,
respectively. Experimental results on public benchmark MoleculeNet show that
the proposed methods have the ability to outperform corresponding
state-of-the-art models.",2022-10-18,2022,2022-10,chemistry
"Solving the Schrodinger equation with genetic algorithms: a practical
  approach","The Schrodinger equation is one of the most important equations in physics
and chemistry and can be solved in the simplest cases by computer numerical
methods. Since the beginning of the 70s of the last century the computer began
to be used to solve this equation in elementary quantum systems, e.g. and in
the most complex case a hydrogen-like system. Obtaining the solution means
finding the wave function, which allows predicting the physical and chemical
properties of the quantum system. However, when a quantum system is more
complex than a hydrogen-like system then we must be satisfied with an
approximate solution of the equation. During the last decade the application of
algorithms and principles of quantum computation in disciplines other than
physics and chemistry, such as biology and artificial intelligence, has led to
the search for alternative techniques with which to obtain approximate
solutions of the Schrodinger equation. In this paper, we review and illustrate
the application of genetic algorithms, i.e. stochastic optimization procedures
inspired by Darwinian evolution, in elementary quantum systems and in quantum
models of artificial intelligence. In this last field, we illustrate with two
toy models how to solve the Schrodinger equation in an elementary model of a
quantum neuron and in the synthesis of quantum circuits controlling the
behavior of a Braitenberg vehicle.",2022-10-27,2022,2022-10,chemistry
"Exploring the Advantages of Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks in
  Generative Chemistry","De novo drug design with desired biological activities is crucial for
developing novel therapeutics for patients. The drug development process is
time and resource-consuming, and it has a low probability of success. Recent
advances in machine learning and deep learning technology have reduced the time
and cost of the discovery process and therefore, improved pharmaceutical
research and development. In this paper, we explore the combination of two
rapidly-developing fields with lead candidate discovery in the drug development
process. First, Artificial intelligence has already been demonstrated to
successfully accelerate conventional drug design approaches. Second, quantum
computing has demonstrated promising potential in different applications, such
as quantum chemistry, combinatorial optimizations, and machine learning. This
manuscript explores hybrid quantum-classical generative adversarial networks
(GAN) for small molecule discovery. We substituted each element of GAN with a
variational quantum circuit (VQC) and demonstrated the quantum advantages in
the small drug discovery. Utilizing a VQC in the noise generator of a GAN to
generate small molecules achieves better physicochemical properties and
performance in the goal-directed benchmark than the classical counterpart.
Moreover, we demonstrate the potential of a VQC with only tens of learnable
parameters in the generator of GAN to generate small molecules. We also
demonstrate the quantum advantage of a VQC in the discriminator of GAN. In this
hybrid model, the number of learnable parameters is significantly less than the
classical ones, and it can still generate valid molecules. The hybrid model
with only tens of training parameters in the quantum discriminator outperforms
the MLP-based one in terms of both generated molecule properties and the
achieved KL divergence.",2022-10-30,2022,2022-10,chemistry
"QuACK: Accelerating Gradient-Based Quantum Optimization with Koopman
  Operator Learning","Quantum optimization, a key application of quantum computing, has
traditionally been stymied by the linearly increasing complexity of gradient
calculations with an increasing number of parameters. This work bridges the gap
between Koopman operator theory, which has found utility in applications
because it allows for a linear representation of nonlinear dynamical systems,
and natural gradient methods in quantum optimization, leading to a significant
acceleration of gradient-based quantum optimization. We present Quantum-circuit
Alternating Controlled Koopman learning (QuACK), a novel framework that
leverages an alternating algorithm for efficient prediction of gradient
dynamics on quantum computers. We demonstrate QuACK's remarkable ability to
accelerate gradient-based optimization across a range of applications in
quantum optimization and machine learning. In fact, our empirical studies,
spanning quantum chemistry, quantum condensed matter, quantum machine learning,
and noisy environments, have shown accelerations of more than 200x speedup in
the overparameterized regime, 10x speedup in the smooth regime, and 3x speedup
in the non-smooth regime. With QuACK, we offer a robust advancement that
harnesses the advantage of gradient-based quantum optimization for practical
benefits.",2022-11-02,2022,2022-11,chemistry
Quantum Deep Dreaming: A Novel Approach for Quantum Circuit Design,"One of the challenges currently facing the quantum computing community is the
design of quantum circuits which can efficiently run on near-term quantum
computers, known as the quantum compiling problem. Algorithms such as the
Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), Quantum Approximate Optimization
Algorithm (QAOA), and Quantum Architecture Search (QAS) have been shown to
generate or find optimal near-term quantum circuits. However, these methods are
computationally expensive and yield little insight into the circuit design
process. In this paper, we propose Quantum Deep Dreaming (QDD), an algorithm
that generates optimal quantum circuit architectures for specified objectives,
such as ground state preparation, while providing insight into the circuit
design process. In QDD, we first train a neural network to predict some
property of a quantum circuit (such as VQE energy). Then, we employ the Deep
Dreaming technique on the trained network to iteratively update an initial
circuit to achieve a target property value (such as ground state VQE energy).
Importantly, this iterative updating allows us to analyze the intermediate
circuits of the dreaming process and gain insights into the circuit features
that the network is modifying during dreaming. We demonstrate that QDD
successfully generates, or 'dreams', circuits of six qubits close to ground
state energy (Transverse Field Ising Model VQE energy) and that dreaming
analysis yields circuit design insights. QDD is designed to optimize circuits
with any target property and can be applied to circuit design problems both
within and outside of quantum chemistry. Hence, QDD lays the foundation for the
future discovery of optimized quantum circuits and for increased
interpretability of automated quantum algorithm design.",2022-11-05,2022,2022-11,chemistry
Toward Human-AI Co-creation to Accelerate Material Discovery,"There is an increasing need in our society to achieve faster advances in
Science to tackle urgent problems, such as climate changes, environmental
hazards, sustainable energy systems, pandemics, among others. In certain
domains like chemistry, scientific discovery carries the extra burden of
assessing risks of the proposed novel solutions before moving to the
experimental stage. Despite several recent advances in Machine Learning and AI
to address some of these challenges, there is still a gap in technologies to
support end-to-end discovery applications, integrating the myriad of available
technologies into a coherent, orchestrated, yet flexible discovery process.
Such applications need to handle complex knowledge management at scale,
enabling knowledge consumption and production in a timely and efficient way for
subject matter experts (SMEs). Furthermore, the discovery of novel functional
materials strongly relies on the development of exploration strategies in the
chemical space. For instance, generative models have gained attention within
the scientific community due to their ability to generate enormous volumes of
novel molecules across material domains. These models exhibit extreme
creativity that often translates in low viability of the generated candidates.
In this work, we propose a workbench framework that aims at enabling the
human-AI co-creation to reduce the time until the first discovery and the
opportunity costs involved. This framework relies on a knowledge base with
domain and process knowledge, and user-interaction components to acquire
knowledge and advise the SMEs. Currently,the framework supports four main
activities: generative modeling, dataset triage, molecule adjudication, and
risk assessment.",2022-11-05,2022,2022-11,chemistry
Model free variable importance for high dimensional data,"A model-agnostic variable importance method can be used with arbitrary
prediction functions. Here we present some model-free methods that do not
require access to the prediction function. This is useful when that function is
proprietary and not available, or just extremely expensive. It is also useful
when studying residuals from a model. The cohort Shapley (CS) method is
model-free but has exponential cost in the dimension of the input space. A
supervised on-manifold Shapley method from Frye et al. (2020) is also model
free but requires as input a second black box model that has to be trained for
the Shapley value problem. We introduce an integrated gradient (IG) version of
cohort Shapley, called IGCS, with cost $\mathcal{O}(nd)$. We show that over the
vast majority of the relevant unit cube that the IGCS value function is close
to a multilinear function for which IGCS matches CS. Another benefit of IGCS is
that is allows IG methods to be used with binary predictors. We use some area
between curves (ABC) measures to quantify the performance of IGCS. On a problem
from high energy physics we verify that IGCS has nearly the same ABCs as CS
does. We also use it on a problem from computational chemistry in 1024
variables. We see there that IGCS attains much higher ABCs than we get from
Monte Carlo sampling. The code is publicly available at

  Error Mitigation, Circuit Compilation, Benchmarking and Classical Simulation","Quantum computing is a game-changing technology for global academia, research
centers and industries including computational science, mathematics, finance,
pharmaceutical, materials science, chemistry and cryptography. Although it has
seen a major boost in the last decade, we are still a long way from reaching
the maturity of a full-fledged quantum computer. That said, we will be in the
Noisy-Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era for a long time, working on dozens
or even thousands of qubits quantum computing systems. An outstanding
challenge, then, is to come up with an application that can reliably carry out
a nontrivial task of interest on the near-term quantum devices with
non-negligible quantum noise. To address this challenge, several near-term
quantum computing techniques, including variational quantum algorithms, error
mitigation, quantum circuit compilation and benchmarking protocols, have been
proposed to characterize and mitigate errors, and to implement algorithms with
a certain resistance to noise, so as to enhance the capabilities of near-term
quantum devices and explore the boundaries of their ability to realize useful
applications. Besides, the development of near-term quantum devices is
inseparable from the efficient classical simulation, which plays a vital role
in quantum algorithm design and verification, error-tolerant verification and
other applications. This review will provide a thorough introduction of these
near-term quantum computing techniques, report on their progress, and finally
discuss the future prospect of these techniques, which we hope will motivate
researchers to undertake additional studies in this field.",2022-11-16,2022,2022-11,chemistry
"SnCQA: A hardware-efficient equivariant quantum convolutional circuit
  architecture","We propose SnCQA, a set of hardware-efficient variational circuits of
equivariant quantum convolutional circuits respective to permutation symmetries

permutation symmetries of the system, such as lattice Hamiltonians common to
many quantum many-body and quantum chemistry problems, Our quantum neural
networks are suitable for solving machine learning problems where permutation
symmetries are present, which could lead to significant savings of
computational costs. Aside from its theoretical novelty, we find our
simulations perform well in practical instances of learning ground states in
quantum computational chemistry, where we could achieve comparable performances
to traditional methods with few tens of parameters. Compared to other
traditional variational quantum circuits, such as the pure hardware-efficient
ansatz (pHEA), we show that SnCQA is more scalable, accurate, and noise
resilient (with $20\times$ better performance on $3 \times 4$ square lattice

"Accelerating Inverse Learning via Intelligent Localization with
  Exploratory Sampling","In the scope of ""AI for Science"", solving inverse problems is a longstanding
challenge in materials and drug discovery, where the goal is to determine the
hidden structures given a set of desirable properties. Deep generative models
are recently proposed to solve inverse problems, but these currently use
expensive forward operators and struggle in precisely localizing the exact
solutions and fully exploring the parameter spaces without missing solutions.
In this work, we propose a novel approach (called iPage) to accelerate the
inverse learning process by leveraging probabilistic inference from deep
invertible models and deterministic optimization via fast gradient descent.
Given a target property, the learned invertible model provides a posterior over
the parameter space; we identify these posterior samples as an intelligent
prior initialization which enables us to narrow down the search space. We then
perform gradient descent to calibrate the inverse solutions within a local
region. Meanwhile, a space-filling sampling is imposed on the latent space to
better explore and capture all possible solutions. We evaluate our approach on
three benchmark tasks and two created datasets with real-world applications
from quantum chemistry and additive manufacturing, and find our method achieves
superior performance compared to several state-of-the-art baseline methods. The

"Multi-modal Molecule Structure-text Model for Text-based Retrieval and

However, existing studies use machine learning to mainly utilize the chemical

textual descriptions via a contrastive learning strategy. To train MoleculeSTM,
we construct a large multi-modal dataset, namely, PubChemSTM, with over 280,000
chemical structure-text pairs. To demonstrate the effectiveness and utility of
MoleculeSTM, we design two challenging zero-shot tasks based on text

Ontology Pre-training for Poison Prediction,"Integrating human knowledge into neural networks has the potential to improve
their robustness and interpretability. We have developed a novel approach to
integrate knowledge from ontologies into the structure of a Transformer network
which we call ontology pre-training: we train the network to predict membership
in ontology classes as a way to embed the structure of the ontology into the
network, and subsequently fine-tune the network for the particular prediction
task. We apply this approach to a case study in predicting the potential
toxicity of a small molecule based on its molecular structure, a challenging
task for machine learning in life sciences chemistry. Our approach improves on
the state of the art, and moreover has several additional benefits. First, we
are able to show that the model learns to focus attention on more meaningful
chemical groups when making predictions with ontology pre-training than
without, paving a path towards greater robustness and interpretability. Second,
the training time is reduced after ontology pre-training, indicating that the
model is better placed to learn what matters for toxicity prediction with the
ontology pre-training than without. This strategy has general applicability as
a neuro-symbolic approach to embed meaningful semantics into neural networks.",2023-01-20,2023,2023-01,chemistry

"HOAX: A Hyperparameter Optimization Algorithm Explorer for Neural
  Networks","Computational chemistry has become an important tool to predict and
understand molecular properties and reactions. Even though recent years have
seen a significant growth in new algorithms and computational methods that
speed up quantum chemical calculations, the bottleneck for trajectory-based
methods to study photoinduced processes is still the huge number of electronic
structure calculations. In this work, we present an innovative solution, in
which the amount of electronic structure calculations is drastically reduced,
by employing machine learning algorithms and methods borrowed from the realm of
artificial intelligence. However, applying these algorithms effectively
requires finding optimal hyperparameters, which remains a challenge itself.
Here we present an automated user-friendly framework, HOAX, to perform the
hyperparameter optimization for neural networks, which bypasses the need for a
lengthy manual process. The neural network generated potential energy surfaces
(PESs) reduces the computational costs compared to the ab initio-based PESs. We
perform a comparative investigation on the performance of different
hyperparameter optimiziation algorithms, namely grid search, simulated
annealing, genetic algorithm, and bayesian optimizer in finding the optimal
hyperparameters necessary for constructing the well-performing neural network
in order to fit the PESs of small organic molecules. Our results show that this
automated toolkit not only facilitate a straightforward way to perform the

"Molecular Geometry-aware Transformer for accurate 3D Atomic System
  modeling","Molecular dynamic simulations are important in computational physics,
chemistry, material, and biology. Machine learning-based methods have shown
strong abilities in predicting molecular energy and properties and are much
faster than DFT calculations. Molecular energy is at least related to atoms,
bonds, bond angles, torsion angles, and nonbonding atom pairs. Previous
Transformer models only use atoms as inputs which lack explicit modeling of the
aforementioned factors. To alleviate this limitation, we propose Moleformer, a
novel Transformer architecture that takes nodes (atoms) and edges (bonds and
nonbonding atom pairs) as inputs and models the interactions among them using
rotational and translational invariant geometry-aware spatial encoding.
Proposed spatial encoding calculates relative position information including
distances and angles among nodes and edges. We benchmark Moleformer on OC20 and
QM9 datasets, and our model achieves state-of-the-art on the initial state to
relaxed energy prediction of OC20 and is very competitive in QM9 on predicting
quantum chemical properties compared to other Transformer and Graph Neural
Network (GNN) methods which proves the effectiveness of the proposed

"Diversity Through Exclusion (DTE): Niche Identification for
  Reinforcement Learning through Value-Decomposition","Many environments contain numerous available niches of variable value, each
associated with a different local optimum in the space of behaviors (policy
space). In such situations it is often difficult to design a learning process
capable of evading distraction by poor local optima long enough to stumble upon
the best available niche. In this work we propose a generic reinforcement
learning (RL) algorithm that performs better than baseline deep Q-learning
algorithms in such environments with multiple variably-valued niches. The
algorithm we propose consists of two parts: an agent architecture and a
learning rule. The agent architecture contains multiple sub-policies. The
learning rule is inspired by fitness sharing in evolutionary computation and
applied in reinforcement learning using Value-Decomposition-Networks in a novel
manner for a single-agent's internal population. It can concretely be
understood as adding an extra loss term where one policy's experience is also
used to update all the other policies in a manner that decreases their value
estimates for the visited states. In particular, when one sub-policy visits a
particular state frequently this decreases the value predicted for other
sub-policies for going to that state. Further, we introduce an artificial
chemistry inspired platform where it is easy to create tasks with multiple
rewarding strategies utilizing different resources (i.e. multiple niches). We
show that agents trained this way can escape poor-but-attractive local optima
to instead converge to harder-to-discover higher value strategies in both the
artificial chemistry environments and in simpler illustrative environments.",2023-02-02,2023,2023-02,chemistry
"Dynamical Equations With Bottom-up Self-Organizing Properties Learn
  Accurate Dynamical Hierarchies Without Any Loss Function","Self-organization is ubiquitous in nature and mind. However, machine learning
and theories of cognition still barely touch the subject. The hurdle is that
general patterns are difficult to define in terms of dynamical equations and
designing a system that could learn by reordering itself is still to be seen.
Here, we propose a learning system, where patterns are defined within the realm
of nonlinear dynamics with positive and negative feedback loops, allowing
attractor-repeller pairs to emerge for each pattern observed. Experiments
reveal that such a system can map temporal to spatial correlation, enabling
hierarchical structures to be learned from sequential data. The results are
accurate enough to surpass state-of-the-art unsupervised learning algorithms in
seven out of eight experiments as well as two real-world problems.
Interestingly, the dynamic nature of the system makes it inherently adaptive,
giving rise to phenomena similar to phase transitions in
chemistry/thermodynamics when the input structure changes. Thus, the work here
sheds light on how self-organization can allow for pattern recognition and
hints at how intelligent behavior might emerge from simple dynamic equations

"PrefixMol: Target- and Chemistry-aware Molecule Design via Prefix
  Embedding","Is there a unified model for generating molecules considering different
conditions, such as binding pockets and chemical properties? Although
target-aware generative models have made significant advances in drug design,
they do not consider chemistry conditions and cannot guarantee the desired
chemical properties. Unfortunately, merging the target-aware and chemical-aware
models into a unified model to meet customized requirements may lead to the
problem of negative transfer. Inspired by the success of multi-task learning in
the NLP area, we use prefix embeddings to provide a novel generative model that
considers both the targeted pocket's circumstances and a variety of chemical
properties. All conditional information is represented as learnable features,
which the generative model subsequently employs as a contextual prompt.
Experiments show that our model exhibits good controllability in both single
and multi-conditional molecular generation. The controllability enables us to
outperform previous structure-based drug design methods. More interestingly, we
open up the attention mechanism and reveal coupling relationships between
conditions, providing guidance for multi-conditional molecule generation.",2023-02-14,2023,2023-02,chemistry
"CHA2: CHemistry Aware Convex Hull Autoencoder Towards Inverse Molecular
  Design","Optimizing molecular design and discovering novel chemical structures to meet
certain objectives, such as quantitative estimates of the drug-likeness score
(QEDs), is NP-hard due to the vast combinatorial design space of discrete
molecular structures, which makes it near impossible to explore the entire
search space comprehensively to exploit de novo structures with properties of
interest. To address this challenge, reducing the intractable search space into
a lower-dimensional latent volume helps examine molecular candidates more
feasibly via inverse design. Autoencoders are suitable deep learning
techniques, equipped with an encoder that reduces the discrete molecular
structure into a latent space and a decoder that inverts the search space back
to the molecular design. The continuous property of the latent space, which
characterizes the discrete chemical structures, provides a flexible
representation for inverse design in order to discover novel molecules.
However, exploring this latent space requires certain insights to generate new
structures. We propose using a convex hall surrounding the top molecules in
terms of high QEDs to ensnare a tight subspace in the latent representation as
an efficient way to reveal novel molecules with high QEDs. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our suggested method by using the QM9 as a training dataset
along with the Self- Referencing Embedded Strings (SELFIES) representation to
calibrate the autoencoder in order to carry out the Inverse molecular design
that leads to unfold novel chemical structure.",2023-02-21,2023,2023-02,chemistry
Neuro-symbolic Commonsense Social Reasoning,"Social norms underlie all human social interactions, yet formalizing and
reasoning with them remains a major challenge for AI systems. We present a
novel system for taking social rules of thumb (ROTs) in natural language from
the Social Chemistry 101 dataset and converting them to first-order logic where
reasoning is performed using a neuro-symbolic theorem prover. We accomplish
this in several steps. First, ROTs are converted into Abstract Meaning
Representation (AMR), which is a graphical representation of the concepts in a
sentence, and align the AMR with RoBERTa embeddings. We then generate alternate
simplified versions of the AMR via a novel algorithm, recombining and merging
embeddings for added robustness against different wordings of text, and
incorrect AMR parses. The AMR is then converted into first-order logic, and is
queried with a neuro-symbolic theorem prover. The goal of this paper is to
develop and evaluate a neuro-symbolic method which performs explicit reasoning
about social situations in a logical form.",2023-03-14,2023,2023-03,chemistry
"HomPINNs: homotopy physics-informed neural networks for solving the
  inverse problems of nonlinear differential equations with multiple solutions","Due to the complex behavior arising from non-uniqueness, symmetry, and
bifurcations in the solution space, solving inverse problems of nonlinear
differential equations (DEs) with multiple solutions is a challenging task. To
address this, we propose homotopy physics-informed neural networks (HomPINNs),
a novel framework that leverages homotopy continuation and neural networks
(NNs) to solve inverse problems. The proposed framework begins with the use of
NNs to simultaneously approximate unlabeled observations across diverse
solutions while adhering to DE constraints. Through homotopy continuation, the
proposed method solves the inverse problem by tracing the observations and
identifying multiple solutions. The experiments involve testing the performance
of the proposed method on one-dimensional DEs and applying it to solve a
two-dimensional Gray-Scott simulation. Our findings demonstrate that the
proposed method is scalable and adaptable, providing an effective solution for
solving DEs with multiple solutions and unknown parameters. Moreover, it has
significant potential for various applications in scientific computing, such as
modeling complex systems and solving inverse problems in physics, chemistry,
biology, etc.",2023-04-06,2023,2023-04,chemistry
"Deep learning of experimental electrochemistry for battery cathodes
  across diverse compositions","Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a tool for discovering and
optimizing novel battery materials. However, the adoption of AI in battery
cathode representation and discovery is still limited due to the complexity of
optimizing multiple performance properties and the scarcity of high-fidelity

informatics and demonstrate the application in the discovery and optimization
of disordered rocksalt (DRX) cathode materials. We have compiled the
electrochemistry data of DRX cathodes over the past five years, resulting in a
dataset of more than 19,000 discharge voltage profiles on diverse chemistries
spanning 14 different metal species. Learning from this extensive dataset, our
DRXNet model can automatically capture critical features in the cycling curves
of DRX cathodes under various conditions. Illustratively, the model gives
rational predictions of the discharge capacity for diverse compositions in the
Li--Mn--O--F chemical space as well as for high-entropy systems. As a universal
model trained on diverse chemistries, our approach offers a data-driven

"Cluster Flow: how a hierarchical clustering layer make allows deep-NNs
  more resilient to hacking, more human-like and easily implements relational
  reasoning","Despite the huge recent breakthroughs in neural networks (NNs) for artificial
intelligence (specifically deep convolutional networks) such NNs do not achieve
human-level performance: they can be hacked by images that would fool no human
and lack `common sense'. It has been argued that a basis of human-level
intelligence is mankind's ability to perform relational reasoning: the
comparison of different objects, measuring similarity, grasping of relations
between objects and the converse, figuring out the odd one out in a set of
objects. Mankind can even do this with objects they have never seen before.
Here we show how ClusterFlow, a semi-supervised hierarchical clustering
framework can operate on trained NNs utilising the rich multi-dimensional class
and feature data found at the pre-SoftMax layer to build a hyperspacial map of
classes/features and this adds more human-like functionality to modern deep
convolutional neural networks. We demonstrate this with 3 tasks. 1. the
statistical learning based `mistakes' made by infants when attending to images
of cats and dogs. 2. improving both the resilience to hacking images and the
accurate measure of certainty in deep-NNs. 3. Relational reasoning over sets of
images, including those not known to the NN nor seen before. We also
demonstrate that ClusterFlow can work on non-NN data and deal with missing data
by testing it on a Chemistry dataset. This work suggests that modern deep NNs
can be made more human-like without re-training of the NNs. As it is known that
some methods used in deep and convolutional NNs are not biologically plausible
or perhaps even the best approach: the ClusterFlow framework can sit on top of
any NN and will be a useful tool to add as NNs are improved in this regard.",2023-04-27,2023,2023-04,chemistry
An Exploration of Conditioning Methods in Graph Neural Networks,"The flexibility and effectiveness of message passing based graph neural
networks (GNNs) induced considerable advances in deep learning on
graph-structured data. In such approaches, GNNs recursively update node
representations based on their neighbors and they gain expressivity through the
use of node and edge attribute vectors. E.g., in computational tasks such as
physics and chemistry usage of edge attributes such as relative position or
distance proved to be essential. In this work, we address not what kind of
attributes to use, but how to condition on this information to improve model
performance. We consider three types of conditioning; weak, strong, and pure,
which respectively relate to concatenation-based conditioning, gating, and
transformations that are causally dependent on the attributes. This
categorization provides a unifying viewpoint on different classes of GNNs, from
separable convolutions to various forms of message passing networks. We provide
an empirical study on the effect of conditioning methods in several tasks in
computational chemistry.",2023-05-03,2023,2023-05,chemistry
"G-MATT: Single-step Retrosynthesis Prediction using Molecular Grammar
  Tree Transformer","Various template-based and template-free approaches have been proposed for
single-step retrosynthesis prediction in recent years. While these approaches
demonstrate strong performance from a data-driven metrics standpoint, many
model architectures do not incorporate underlying chemistry principles. Here,
we propose a novel chemistry-aware retrosynthesis prediction framework that
combines powerful data-driven models with prior domain knowledge. We present a
tree-to-sequence transformer architecture that utilizes hierarchical SMILES
grammar-based trees, incorporating crucial chemistry information that is often
overlooked by SMILES text-based representations, such as local structures and
functional groups. The proposed framework, grammar-based molecular attention
tree transformer (G-MATT), achieves significant performance improvements
compared to baseline retrosynthesis models. G-MATT achieves a promising top-1
accuracy of 51% (top-10 accuracy of 79.1%), invalid rate of 1.5%, and bioactive
similarity rate of 74.8% on the USPTO- 50K dataset. Additional analyses of

"Automated Feedback Generation for a Chemistry Database and Abstracting
  Exercise","Timely feedback is an important part of teaching and learning. Here we
describe how a readily available neural network transformer (machine-learning)
model (BERT) can be used to give feedback on the structure of the response to
an abstracting exercise where students are asked to summarise the contents of a
published article after finding it from a publication database. The dataset
contained 207 submissions from two consecutive years of the course, summarising
a total of 21 different papers from the primary literature. The model was
pre-trained using an available dataset (approx. 15,000 samples) and then
fine-tuned on 80% of the submitted dataset. This fine tuning was seen to be
important. The sentences in the student submissions are characterised into
three classes - background, technique and observation - which allows a
comparison of how each submission is structured. Comparing the structure of the
students' abstract a large collection of those from the PubMed database shows
that students in this exercise concentrate more on the background to the paper
and less on the techniques and results than the abstracts to papers themselves.
The results allowed feedback for each submitted assignment to be automatically

"Have LLMs Advanced Enough? A Challenging Problem Solving Benchmark For
  Large Language Models","The performance of large language models (LLMs) on existing reasoning
benchmarks has significantly improved over the past years. In response, we
present JEEBench, a considerably more challenging benchmark dataset for
evaluating the problem solving abilities of LLMs. We curate 515 challenging
pre-engineering mathematics, physics and chemistry problems from the highly
competitive IIT JEE-Advanced exam. Long-horizon reasoning on top of deep
in-domain knowledge is essential for solving problems in this benchmark. Our
evaluation on various open-source and proprietary models reveals that the
highest performance, even after using techniques like self-consistency,
self-refinement and chain-of-thought prompting, is less than 40%. The typical
failure modes of GPT-4, the best model, are errors in algebraic manipulation,
difficulty in grounding abstract concepts into mathematical equations
accurately and failure in retrieving relevant domain-specific concepts. We also
observe that by mere prompting, GPT-4 is unable to assess risk introduced by
negative marking for incorrect answers. For this, we develop a post-hoc
confidence-thresholding method over self-consistency, which enables effective
response selection. We hope that our challenging benchmark will guide future
re-search in problem-solving using LLMs.",2023-05-24,2023,2023-05,chemistry
"Metrics for quantifying isotropy in high dimensional unsupervised
  clustering tasks in a materials context","Clustering is a common task in machine learning, but clusters of unlabelled
data can be hard to quantify. The application of clustering algorithms in
chemistry is often dependant on material representation. Ascertaining the
effects of different representations, clustering algorithms, or data
transformations on the resulting clusters is difficult due to the
dimensionality of these data. We present a thorough analysis of measures for
isotropy of a cluster, including a novel implantation based on an existing
derivation. Using fractional anisotropy, a common method used in medical
imaging for comparison, we then expand these measures to examine the average
isotropy of a set of clusters. A use case for such measures is demonstrated by
quantifying the effects of kernel approximation functions on different
representations of the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database. Broader
applicability of these methods is demonstrated in analysing learnt embedding of
the MNIST dataset. Random clusters are explored to examine the differences

LLMs in a wide range of tasks across the chemistry domain. We identify three
key chemistry-related capabilities including understanding, reasoning and
explaining to explore in LLMs and establish a benchmark containing eight

the recent success of ChatGPT's (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer)
few-shot methods surpassing BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representation from

Hence, the development of few-shot techniques for catalysis is critical and

the Few-Shot Open Catalyst Challenge 2023, a competition aimed at advancing the
application of machine learning technology for predicting catalytic reactions

results demonstrate that CDGNN effectively learns embeddings from catalytic

accomplishment has resulted in the utmost advanced and efficient determination
of the reaction pathway for hydrogen peroxide, surpassing the current graph

chemSKI with tokens: world building and economy in the SKI universe,"chemSKI with tokens is a confluent graph rewrite system where all rewrites

CIN++: Enhancing Topological Message Passing,"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in learning
from graph-structured data. However, they face significant limitations in
expressive power, struggling with long-range interactions and lacking a
principled approach to modeling higher-order structures and group interactions.
Cellular Isomorphism Networks (CINs) recently addressed most of these
challenges with a message passing scheme based on cell complexes. Despite their
advantages, CINs make use only of boundary and upper messages which do not
consider a direct interaction between the rings present in the underlying
complex. Accounting for these interactions might be crucial for learning
representations of many real-world complex phenomena such as the dynamics of
supramolecular assemblies, neural activity within the brain, and gene
regulation processes. In this work, we propose CIN++, an enhancement of the
topological message passing scheme introduced in CINs. Our message passing
scheme accounts for the aforementioned limitations by letting the cells to
receive also lower messages within each layer. By providing a more
comprehensive representation of higher-order and long-range interactions, our
enhanced topological message passing scheme achieves state-of-the-art results
on large-scale and long-range chemistry benchmarks.",2023-06-06,2023,2023-06,chemistry

"Symmetry-Informed Geometric Representation for Molecules, Proteins, and

significant interest within the machine learning and scientific communities,
particularly in the domains of chemistry, biology, and material discovery. For
these scientific problems, molecules serve as the fundamental building blocks,
and machine learning has emerged as a highly effective and powerful tool for
modeling their geometric structures. Nevertheless, due to the rapidly evolving
process of the field and the knowledge gap between science (e.g., physics,

equivariance with vector frame basis. Then we propose a platform, coined
Geom3D, which enables benchmarking the effectiveness of geometric strategies.
Geom3D contains 16 advanced symmetry-informed geometric representation models
and 14 geometric pretraining methods over 46 diverse datasets, including small
molecules, proteins, and crystalline materials. We hope that Geom3D can, on the

On the Interplay of Subset Selection and Informed Graph Neural Networks,"Machine learning techniques paired with the availability of massive datasets
dramatically enhance our ability to explore the chemical compound space by
providing fast and accurate predictions of molecular properties. However,
learning on large datasets is strongly limited by the availability of
computational resources and can be infeasible in some scenarios. Moreover, the
instances in the datasets may not yet be labelled and generating the labels can
be costly, as in the case of quantum chemistry computations. Thus, there is a
need to select small training subsets from large pools of unlabelled data
points and to develop reliable ML methods that can effectively learn from small
training sets. This work focuses on predicting the molecules atomization energy
in the QM9 dataset. We investigate the advantages of employing domain
knowledge-based data sampling methods for an efficient training set selection
combined with informed ML techniques. In particular, we show how maximizing
molecular diversity in the training set selection process increases the

"Rotation-Invariant Random Features Provide a Strong Baseline for Machine
  Learning on 3D Point Clouds","Rotational invariance is a popular inductive bias used by many fields in
machine learning, such as computer vision and machine learning for quantum

rotation-invariant features, or they use general-purpose deep neural networks

success of these methods is primarily due to the rotation invariance or the
deep neural networks. To address this question, we suggest a simple and
general-purpose method for learning rotation-invariant functions of
three-dimensional point cloud data using a random features approach.
Specifically, we extend the random features method of Rahimi & Recht 2007 by
deriving a version that is invariant to three-dimensional rotations and showing
that it is fast to evaluate on point cloud data. We show through experiments
that our method matches or outperforms the performance of general-purpose
rotation-invariant neural networks on standard molecular property prediction

U-RadIT modalities; c.) Data and algorithms; and d.) Applications.
Hardware-centric approaches to U-RadIT optimization are constrained by detector
material properties, low signal-to-noise ratio, high cost and long development
cycles of critical hardware components such as ASICs. Interpretation of
experimental data, including comparisons with forward models, is frequently
hindered by sparse measurements, model and measurement uncertainties, and
noise. Alternatively, U-RadIT make increasing use of data science and machine
learning algorithms, including experimental implementations of compressed
sensing. Machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches, refined by
physics and materials information, may also contribute significantly to data
interpretation, uncertainty quantification, and U-RadIT optimization.",2023-08-21,2023,2023-08,chemistry
Beyond MD17: the reactive xxMD dataset,"System specific neural force fields (NFFs) have gained popularity in
computational chemistry. One of the most popular datasets as a bencharmk to
develop NFFs models is the MD17 dataset and its subsequent extension. These
datasets comprise geometries from the equilibrium region of the ground
electronic state potential energy surface, sampled from direct adiabatic
dynamics. However, many chemical reactions involve significant molecular
geometrical deformations, for example, bond breaking. Therefore, MD17 is
inadequate to represent a chemical reaction. To address this limitation in
MD17, we introduce a new dataset, called Extended Excited-state Molecular
Dynamics (xxMD) dataset. The xxMD dataset involves geometries sampled from
direct non-adiabatic dynamics, and the energies are computed at both
multireference wavefunction theory and density functional theory. We show that
the xxMD dataset involves diverse geometries which represent chemical
reactions. Assessment of NFF models on xxMD dataset reveals significantly
higher predictive errors than those reported for MD17 and its variants. This
work underscores the challenges faced in crafting a generalizable NFF model
with extrapolation capability.",2023-08-22,2023,2023-08,chemistry
DARWIN Series: Domain Specific Large Language Models for Natural Science,"Emerging tools bring forth fresh approaches to work, and the field of natural
science is no different. In natural science, traditional manual, serial, and
labour-intensive work is being augmented by automated, parallel, and iterative
processes driven by artificial intelligence-based experimental automation and
more. To add new capabilities in natural science, enabling the acceleration and
enrichment of automation of the discovery process, we present DARWIN, a series
of tailored LLMs for natural science, mainly in physics, chemistry, and
material science. This series relies on open-source LLM, incorporating
structured and unstructured scientific knowledge from public datasets and
literature. We fine-tuned the models using over 60,000 instruction data points,
emphasizing factual correctness. During the fine-tuning, we introduce the
Scientific Instruction Generation (SIG) model, automating instruction
generation from scientific texts. This eliminates the need for manual
extraction or domain-specific knowledge graphs and efficiently injects
scientific knowledge into the model. We also explore multi-task training
strategies, revealing interconnections between scientific tasks. DARWIN series
not only achieves state-of-the-art results on various scientific tasks but also
diminishes reliance on closed-source AI models. Our research showcases the
ability of LLM in the scientific domain, with the overarching goal of fostering
prosperity within the broader AI for science community.",2023-08-25,2023,2023-08,chemistry
"Enabling Inverse Design in Chemical Compound Space: Mapping Quantum
  Properties to Structures for Small Organic Molecules","Computer-driven molecular design combines the principles of chemistry,
physics, and artificial intelligence to identify novel chemical compounds and
materials with desired properties for a specific application. In particular,
quantum-mechanical (QM) methods combined with machine learning (ML) techniques
have accelerated the estimation of accurate molecular properties, providing a
direct mapping from 3D molecular structures to their properties. However, the
development of reliable and efficient methodologies to enable \emph{inverse
mapping} in chemical space is a long-standing challenge that has not been
accomplished yet. Here, we address this challenge by demonstrating the
possibility of parametrizing a given chemical space with a finite set of
extensive and intensive QM properties. In doing so, we develop a
proof-of-concept implementation that combines a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE)
trained on molecular structures with a property encoder designed to learn the
latent representation from a set of QM properties. The result of this joint
architecture is a common latent space representation for both structures and
properties, which enables property-to-structure mapping for small drug-like
molecules contained in the QM7-X dataset. We illustrate the capabilities of our
approach by conditional generation of \emph{de novo} molecular structures with
targeted properties, transition path interpolation for chemical reactions as
well as insights into property-structure relationships. Our findings thus
provide a proof-of-principle demonstration aiming to enable the inverse
property-to-structure design in diverse chemical spaces.",2023-09-01,2023,2023-09,chemistry
"Gramian Angular Fields for leveraging pretrained computer vision models
  with anomalous diffusion trajectories","Anomalous diffusion is present at all scales, from atomic to large scales.
Some exemplary systems are; ultra-cold atoms, telomeres in the nucleus of
cells, moisture transport in cement-based materials, the free movement of
arthropods, and the migration patterns of birds. The characterization of the
diffusion gives critical information about the dynamics of these systems and
provides an interdisciplinary framework with which to study diffusive
transport. Thus, the problem of identifying underlying diffusive regimes and
inferring the anomalous diffusion exponent {$\alpha$} with high confidence is
critical to physics, chemistry, biology, and ecology. Classification and
analysis of raw trajectories combining machine learning techniques with
statistics extracted from them have widely been studied in the Anomalous
Diffusion Challenge ge (Munoz-Gil et al., 2021). Here we present a new
data-driven method for working with diffusive trajectories. This method
utilizes Gramian Angular Fields (GAF) to encode one-dimensional trajectories as
images (Gramian Matrices), while preserving their spatiotemporal structure for
input to computer-vision models. This allows us to leverage two
well-established pre-trained computer-vision models, ResNet and MobileNet, to
characterize the underlying diffusive regime, and infer the anomalous diffusion
exponent {$\alpha$}. Short raw trajectories, of lengths between 10 and 50, are
commonly encountered in single-particle tracking experiments and are the most
difficult to characterize. We show that by using GAF images, we can outperform
the current state-of-the-art while increasing accessibility to machine learning
methods in an applied setting.",2023-09-02,2023,2023-09,chemistry
"Insights Into the Inner Workings of Transformer Models for Protein
  Function Prediction","Motivation: We explored how explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) can
help to shed light into the inner workings of neural networks for protein
function prediction, by extending the widely used XAI method of integrated
gradients such that latent representations inside of transformer models, which
were finetuned to Gene Ontology term and Enzyme Commission number prediction,
can be inspected too. Results: The approach enabled us to identify amino acids
in the sequences that the transformers pay particular attention to, and to show
that these relevant sequence parts reflect expectations from biology and
chemistry, both in the embedding layer and inside of the model, where we
identified transformer heads with a statistically significant correspondence of
attribution maps with ground truth sequence annotations (e.g. transmembrane
regions, active sites) across many proteins. Availability and Implementation:

"CloudBrain-NMR: An Intelligent Cloud Computing Platform for NMR
  Spectroscopy Processing, Reconstruction and Analysis","Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has served as a powerful
analytical tool for studying molecular structure and dynamics in chemistry and
biology. However, the processing of raw data acquired from NMR spectrometers
and subsequent quantitative analysis involves various specialized tools, which
necessitates comprehensive knowledge in programming and NMR. Particularly, the
emerging deep learning tools is hard to be widely used in NMR due to the
sophisticated setup of computation. Thus, NMR processing is not an easy task
for chemist and biologists. In this work, we present CloudBrain-NMR, an
intelligent online cloud computing platform designed for NMR data reading,

Molecular Conformation Generation via Shifting Scores,"Molecular conformation generation, a critical aspect of computational
chemistry, involves producing the three-dimensional conformer geometry for a
given molecule. Generating molecular conformation via diffusion requires
learning to reverse a noising process. Diffusion on inter-atomic distances
instead of conformation preserves SE(3)-equivalence and shows superior
performance compared to alternative techniques, whereas related generative
modelings are predominantly based upon heuristical assumptions. In response to
this, we propose a novel molecular conformation generation approach driven by
the observation that the disintegration of a molecule can be viewed as casting
increasing force fields to its composing atoms, such that the distribution of
the change of inter-atomic distance shifts from Gaussian to Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution. The corresponding generative modeling ensures a feasible
inter-atomic distance geometry and exhibits time reversibility. Experimental
results on molecular datasets demonstrate the advantages of the proposed
shifting distribution compared to the state-of-the-art.",2023-09-12,2023,2023-09,chemistry
"GPT-Lab: Next Generation Of Optimal Chemistry Discovery By GPT Driven
  Robotic Lab","The integration of robots in chemical experiments has enhanced experimental
efficiency, but lacking the human intelligence to comprehend literature, they
seldom provide assistance in experimental design. Therefore, achieving
full-process autonomy from experiment design to validation in self-driven

Pre-trained Transformers (GPT), particularly GPT-4, into robotic
experimentation offers a solution. We introduce GPT-Lab, a paradigm that
employs GPT models to give robots human-like intelligence. With our robotic
experimentation platform, GPT-Lab mines literature for materials and methods
and validates findings through high-throughput synthesis. As a demonstration,
GPT-Lab analyzed 500 articles, identified 18 potential reagents, and
successfully produced an accurate humidity colorimetric sensor with a root mean

"Machine Learning Data Suitability and Performance Testing Using Fault
  Injection Testing Framework","Creating resilient machine learning (ML) systems has become necessary to
ensure production-ready ML systems that acquire user confidence seamlessly. The
quality of the input data and the model highly influence the successful
end-to-end testing in data-sensitive systems. However, the testing approaches
of input data are not as systematic and are few compared to model testing. To
address this gap, this paper presents the Fault Injection for Undesirable
Learning in input Data (FIUL-Data) testing framework that tests the resilience
of ML models to multiple intentionally-triggered data faults. Data mutators
explore vulnerabilities of ML systems against the effects of different fault
injections. The proposed framework is designed based on three main ideas: The
mutators are not random; one data mutator is applied at an instance of time,
and the selected ML models are optimized beforehand. This paper evaluates the
FIUL-Data framework using data from analytical chemistry, comprising retention
time measurements of anti-sense oligonucleotide. Empirical evaluation is
carried out in a two-step process in which the responses of selected ML models
to data mutation are analyzed individually and then compared with each other.
The results show that the FIUL-Data framework allows the evaluation of the
resilience of ML models. In most experiments cases, ML models show higher
resilience at larger training datasets, where gradient boost performed better
than support vector regression in smaller training sets. Overall, the mean
squared error metric is useful in evaluating the resilience of models due to
its higher sensitivity to data mutation.",2023-09-20,2023,2023-09,chemistry
"Morphological Computing as Logic Underlying Cognition in Human, Animal,
  and Intelligent Machine","This work examines the interconnections between logic, epistemology, and
sciences within the Naturalist tradition. It presents a scheme that connects
logic, mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and cognition, emphasizing
scale-invariant, self-organizing dynamics across organizational tiers of
nature. The inherent logic of agency exists in natural processes at various
levels, under information exchanges. It applies to humans, animals, and
artifactual agents. The common human-centric, natural language-based logic is
an example of complex logic evolved by living organisms that already appears in
the simplest form at the level of basal cognition of unicellular organisms.
Thus, cognitive logic stems from the evolution of physical, chemical, and
biological logic. In a computing nature framework with a self-organizing
agency, innovative computational frameworks grounded in
morphological/physical/natural computation can be used to explain the genesis
of human-centered logic through the steps of naturalized logical processes at
lower levels of organization. The Extended Evolutionary Synthesis of living
agents is essential for understanding the emergence of human-level logic and
the relationship between logic and information processing/computational
epistemology. We conclude that more research is needed to elucidate the details
of the mechanisms linking natural phenomena with the logic of agency in nature.",2023-09-25,2023,2023-09,chemistry
"C3Net: interatomic potential neural network for prediction of

promising recent findings in early-stage drug discovery. Here, we review the
role of language models in molecular discovery, underlining their strength in
de novo drug design, property prediction and reaction chemistry. We highlight
valuable open-source software assets thus lowering the entry barrier to the

Neural scaling laws for phenotypic drug discovery,"Recent breakthroughs by deep neural networks (DNNs) in natural language
processing (NLP) and computer vision have been driven by a scale-up of models
and data rather than the discovery of novel computing paradigms. Here, we
investigate if scale can have a similar impact for models designed to aid small
molecule drug discovery. We address this question through a large-scale and
systematic analysis of how DNN size, data diet, and learning routines interact
to impact accuracy on our Phenotypic Chemistry Arena (Pheno-CA) benchmark: a
diverse set of drug development tasks posed on image-based high content
screening data. Surprisingly, we find that DNNs explicitly supervised to solve
tasks in the Pheno-CA do not continuously improve as their data and model size
is scaled-up. To address this issue, we introduce a novel precursor task, the
Inverse Biological Process (IBP), which is designed to resemble the causal
objective functions that have proven successful for NLP. We indeed find that
DNNs first trained with IBP then probed for performance on the Pheno-CA
significantly outperform task-supervised DNNs. More importantly, the
performance of these IBP-trained DNNs monotonically improves with data and
model scale. Our findings reveal that the DNN ingredients needed to accurately
solve small molecule drug development tasks are already in our hands, and
project how much more experimental data is needed to achieve any desired level
of improvement. We release our Pheno-CA benchmark and code to encourage further
study of neural scaling laws for small molecule drug discovery.",2023-09-28,2023,2023-09,chemistry
"Knowledge Graphs for the Life Sciences: Recent Developments, Challenges

"UPAR: A Kantian-Inspired Prompting Framework for Enhancing Large
  Language Model Capabilities","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive inferential
capabilities, with numerous research endeavors devoted to enhancing this
capacity through prompting. Despite these efforts, a unified epistemological
foundation is still conspicuously absent. Drawing inspiration from Kant's a
priori philosophy, we propose the UPAR prompting framework, designed to emulate
the structure of human cognition within LLMs. The UPAR framework is delineated
into four phases: ""Understand"", ""Plan"", ""Act"", and ""Reflect"", enabling the
extraction of structured information from complex contexts, prior planning of
solutions, execution according to plan, and self-reflection. This structure
significantly augments the explainability and accuracy of LLM inference,
producing a human-understandable and inspectable inferential trajectory.
Furthermore, our work offers an epistemological foundation for existing
prompting techniques, allowing for a possible systematic integration of these
methods. With GPT-4, our approach elevates the accuracy from COT baseline of
22.92% to 58.33% in a challenging subset of GSM8K, and from 67.91% to 75.40% in
the causal judgment task. Without using few-shot examples or external tools,

RELU (IReLU) activation function to improve training of DC NNs. We also
investigate denormalization and label rescaling to help stabilize DC training.

MapperGPT: Large Language Models for Linking and Mapping Entities,"Aligning terminological resources, including ontologies, controlled
vocabularies, taxonomies, and value sets is a critical part of data integration
in many domains such as healthcare, chemistry, and biomedical research. Entity
mapping is the process of determining correspondences between entities across
these resources, such as gene identifiers, disease concepts, or chemical entity
identifiers. Many tools have been developed to compute such mappings based on
common structural features and lexical information such as labels and synonyms.
Lexical approaches in particular often provide very high recall, but low
precision, due to lexical ambiguity. As a consequence of this, mapping efforts
often resort to a labor intensive manual mapping refinement through a human
curator.
  Large Language Models (LLMs), such as the ones employed by ChatGPT, have
generalizable abilities to perform a wide range of tasks, including
question-answering and information extraction. Here we present MapperGPT, an
approach that uses LLMs to review and refine mapping relationships as a
post-processing step, in concert with existing high-recall methods that are
based on lexical and structural heuristics.
  We evaluated MapperGPT on a series of alignment tasks from different domains,
including anatomy, developmental biology, and renal diseases. We devised a
collection of tasks that are designed to be particularly challenging for
lexical methods. We show that when used in combination with high-recall

Evolutionary Retrosynthetic Route Planning,"Molecular retrosynthesis is a significant and complex problem in the field of
chemistry, however, traditional manual synthesis methods not only need
well-trained experts but also are time-consuming. With the development of big
data and machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI) based retrosynthesis is
attracting more attention and has become a valuable tool for molecular
retrosynthesis. At present, Monte Carlo tree search is a mainstream search
framework employed to address this problem. Nevertheless, its search efficiency
is compromised by its large search space. Therefore, this paper proposes a
novel approach for retrosynthetic route planning based on evolutionary
optimization, marking the first use of Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) in the field
of multi-step retrosynthesis. The proposed method involves modeling the
retrosynthetic problem into an optimization problem, defining the search space
and operators. Additionally, to improve the search efficiency, a parallel
strategy is implemented. The new approach is applied to four case products and
compared with Monte Carlo tree search. The experimental results show that, in
comparison to the Monte Carlo tree search algorithm, EA significantly reduces
the number of calling single-step model by an average of 53.9%. The time
required to search three solutions decreases by an average of 83.9%, and the
number of feasible search routes increases by 1.38 times. The source code is

"Cousins Of The Vendi Score: A Family Of Similarity-Based Diversity
  Metrics For Science And Machine Learning","Measuring diversity accurately is important for many scientific fields,
including machine learning (ML), ecology, and chemistry. The Vendi Score was
introduced as a generic similarity-based diversity metric that extends the Hill
number of order q=1 by leveraging ideas from quantum statistical mechanics.
Contrary to many diversity metrics in ecology, the Vendi Score accounts for
similarity and does not require knowledge of the prevalence of the categories
in the collection to be evaluated for diversity. However, the Vendi Score
treats each item in a given collection with a level of sensitivity proportional
to the item's prevalence. This is undesirable in settings where there is a
significant imbalance in item prevalence. In this paper, we extend the other
Hill numbers using similarity to provide flexibility in allocating sensitivity
to rare or common items. This leads to a family of diversity metrics -- Vendi
scores with different levels of sensitivity -- that can be used in a variety of
applications. We study the properties of the scores in a synthetic controlled
setting where the ground truth diversity is known. We then test their utility
in improving molecular simulations via Vendi Sampling. Finally, we use the
Vendi scores to better understand the behavior of image generative models in

with similar local explanations are grouped together. Hence, Slisemap gives us
an overview of the different behaviours of a black box model. This makes
Slisemap into a supervised manifold visualisation method, where the patterns in
the embedding reflect a target property. In this paper we show how Slisemap can

Re-evaluating Retrosynthesis Algorithms with Syntheseus,"Automated Synthesis Planning has recently re-emerged as a research area at
the intersection of chemistry and machine learning. Despite the appearance of

"A Proposed Artificial Neural Network based Approach for Molecules Bitter
  Prediction","In recent years, the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has offered
the possibility to tackle many interdisciplinary problems, and the field of
chemistry is not an exception. Drug analysis is crucial in drug discovery,
playing an important role in human life. However, this task encounters many
difficulties due to the wide range of computational chemistry methods. Drug
analysis also involves a massive amount of work, including determining taste.
Thus, applying deep learning to predict a molecule's bitterness is inevitable
to accelerate innovation in drug analysis by reducing the time spent. This
paper proposes an artificial neural network (ANN) based approach (EC-ANN) for
the molecule's bitter prediction. Our approach took the SMILE (Simplified
molecular-input line-entry system) string of a molecule as the input data for
the prediction, and the 256-bit ECFP descriptor is the input vector for our
network. It showed impressive results compared to state-of-the-art, with a
higher performance on two out of three test sets according to the experiences
on three popular test sets: Phyto-Dictionary, Unimi, and Bitter-new set [1].
For the Phyto-Dictionary test set, our model recorded 0.95 and 0.983 in
F1-score and AUPR, respectively, depicted as the highest score in F1-score. For
the Unimi test set, our model achieved 0.88 in F1-score and 0.88 in AUPR, which
is roughly 12.3% higher than the peak of previous models [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].",2023-11-15,2023,2023-11,chemistry
Structured Chemistry Reasoning with Large Language Models,"Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in diverse areas, yet struggle with
complex scientific reasoning, especially in the field of chemistry. Different
from the simple chemistry tasks (e.g., molecule classification) addressed in
previous studies, complex chemistry problems require not only vast knowledge
and precise calculation, but also compositional reasoning about rich dynamic
interactions of different concepts (e.g., temperature changes). Our study shows
that even advanced LLMs, like GPT-4, can fail easily in different ways.
Interestingly, the errors often stem not from a lack of domain knowledge within
the LLMs, but rather from the absence of an effective reasoning structure that
guides the LLMs to elicit the right knowledge, incorporate the knowledge in
step-by-step reasoning, and iteratively refine results for further improved
quality. On this basis, we introduce StructChem, a simple yet effective
prompting strategy that offers the desired guidance and substantially boosts
the LLMs' chemical reasoning capability. Testing across four chemistry areas --
quantum chemistry, mechanics, physical chemistry, and kinetics -- StructChem
substantially enhances GPT-4's performance, with up to 30\% peak improvement.
Our analysis also underscores the unique difficulties of precise grounded
reasoning in science with LLMs, highlighting a need for more research in this
area. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/ozyyshr/StructChem}.",2023-11-16,2023,2023-11,chemistry
"Chemist-X: Large Language Model-empowered Agent for Reaction Condition
  Recommendation in Chemical Synthesis","Recent AI research plots a promising future of automatic chemical reactions
within the chemistry society. This study proposes Chemist-X, a comprehensive AI
agent that automates the reaction condition optimization (RCO) task in chemical
synthesis with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technology and
AI-controlled wet-lab experiment executions. To begin with, as an emulation on
how chemical experts solve the RCO task, Chemist-X utilizes a novel RAG scheme
to interrogate available molecular and literature databases to narrow the
searching space for later processing. The agent then leverages a computer-aided
design (CAD) tool we have developed through a large language model (LLM)
supervised programming interface. With updated chemical knowledge obtained via
RAG, as well as the ability in using CAD tools, our agent significantly
outperforms conventional RCO AIs confined to the fixed knowledge within its
training data. Finally, Chemist-X interacts with the physical world through an
automated robotic system, which can validate the suggested chemical reaction
condition without human interventions. The control of the robotic system was
achieved with a novel algorithm we have developed for the equipment, which
relies on LLMs for reliable script generation. Results of our automatic wet-lab
experiments, achieved by fully LLM-supervised end-to-end operation with no
human in the lope, prove Chemist-X's ability in self-driving laboratories.",2023-11-16,2023,2023-11,chemistry
Decoding the Molecular Universe -- Workshop Report,"On August 9-10, 2023, a workshop was convened at the Pacific Northwest
National Laboratory (PNNL) in Richland, WA that brought together a group of
internationally recognized experts in metabolomics, natural products discovery,
chemical ecology, chemical and biological threat assessment, cheminformatics,
computational chemistry, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and novel
technology development. These experts were invited to assess the value and
feasibility of a grand-scale project to create new technologies that would
allow the identification and quantification of all small molecules, or to
decode the molecular universe. The Decoding the Molecular Universe project
would extend and complement the success of the Human Genome Project by
developing new capabilities and technologies to measure small molecules
(defined as non-protein, non-polymer molecules less than 1500 Daltons) of any
origin and generated in biological systems or produced abiotically. Workshop
attendees 1) explored what new understanding of biological and environmental
systems could be revealed through the lens of small molecules; 2) characterized
the similarities in current needs and technical challenges between each science
or mission area for unambiguous and comprehensive determination of the
composition and quantities of small molecules of any sample; 3) determined the
extent to which technologies or methods currently exist for unambiguously and
comprehensively determining the small molecule composition of any sample and in
a reasonable time; and 4) identified the attributes of the ideal technology or
approach for universal small molecule measurement and identification. The
workshop concluded with a discussion of how a project of this scale could be
undertaken, possible thrusts for the project, early proof-of-principle
applications, and similar efforts upon which the project could be modeled.",2023-11-19,2023,2023-11,chemistry
"Coarse-Grained Configurational Polymer Fingerprints for Property
  Prediction using Machine Learning","In this work, we present a method to generate a configurational level
fingerprint for polymers using the Bead-Spring-Model. Unlike some of the
previous fingerprinting approaches that employ monomer-level information where
atomistic descriptors are computed using quantum chemistry calculations, this
approach incorporates configurational information from a coarse-grained model
of a long polymer chain. The proposed approach may be advantageous for the
study of behavior resulting from large molecular weights. To create this
fingerprint, we make use of two kinds of descriptors. First, we calculate
certain geometric descriptors like Re2, Rg2 etc. and label them as Calculated
Descriptors. Second, we generate a set of data-driven descriptors using an
unsupervised autoencoder model and call them Learnt Descriptors. Using a
combination of both of them, we are able to learn mappings from the structure
to various properties of the polymer chain by training ML models. We test our
fingerprint to predict the probability of occurrence of a configuration at
equilibrium, which is approximated by a simple linear relationship between the
instantaneous internal energy and equilibrium average internal energy.",2023-11-20,2023,2023-11,chemistry
GPQA: A Graduate-Level Google-Proof Q&A Benchmark,"We present GPQA, a challenging dataset of 448 multiple-choice questions
written by domain experts in biology, physics, and chemistry. We ensure that
the questions are high-quality and extremely difficult: experts who have or are
pursuing PhDs in the corresponding domains reach 65% accuracy (74% when
discounting clear mistakes the experts identified in retrospect), while highly
skilled non-expert validators only reach 34% accuracy, despite spending on
average over 30 minutes with unrestricted access to the web (i.e., the
questions are ""Google-proof""). The questions are also difficult for
state-of-the-art AI systems, with our strongest GPT-4 based baseline achieving
39% accuracy. If we are to use future AI systems to help us answer very hard
questions, for example, when developing new scientific knowledge, we need to
develop scalable oversight methods that enable humans to supervise their
outputs, which may be difficult even if the supervisors are themselves skilled
and knowledgeable. The difficulty of GPQA both for skilled non-experts and
frontier AI systems should enable realistic scalable oversight experiments,
which we hope can help devise ways for human experts to reliably get truthful
information from AI systems that surpass human capabilities.",2023-11-20,2023,2023-11,chemistry
GAIA: a benchmark for General AI Assistants,"We introduce GAIA, a benchmark for General AI Assistants that, if solved,
would represent a milestone in AI research. GAIA proposes real-world questions
that require a set of fundamental abilities such as reasoning, multi-modality
handling, web browsing, and generally tool-use proficiency. GAIA questions are
conceptually simple for humans yet challenging for most advanced AIs: we show
that human respondents obtain 92\% vs. 15\% for GPT-4 equipped with plugins.
This notable performance disparity contrasts with the recent trend of LLMs
outperforming humans on tasks requiring professional skills in e.g. law or
chemistry. GAIA's philosophy departs from the current trend in AI benchmarks
suggesting to target tasks that are ever more difficult for humans. We posit
that the advent of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) hinges on a system's
capability to exhibit similar robustness as the average human does on such
questions. Using GAIA's methodology, we devise 466 questions and their answer.
We release our questions while retaining answers to 300 of them to power a
leader-board available at https://huggingface.co/gaia-benchmark.",2023-11-21,2023,2023-11,chemistry
"ATLANTIC: Structure-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Language Model for
  Interdisciplinary Science","Large language models record impressive performance on many natural language
processing tasks. However, their knowledge capacity is limited to the
pretraining corpus. Retrieval augmentation offers an effective solution by
retrieving context from external knowledge sources to complement the language
model. However, existing retrieval augmentation techniques ignore the
structural relationships between these documents. Furthermore, retrieval models
are not explored much in scientific tasks, especially in regard to the
faithfulness of retrieved documents. In this paper, we propose a novel
structure-aware retrieval augmented language model that accommodates document
structure during retrieval augmentation. We create a heterogeneous document
graph capturing multiple types of relationships (e.g., citation, co-authorship,
etc.) that connect documents from more than 15 scientific disciplines (e.g.,
Physics, Medicine, Chemistry, etc.). We train a graph neural network on the
curated document graph to act as a structural encoder for the corresponding
passages retrieved during the model pretraining. Particularly, along with text
embeddings of the retrieved passages, we obtain structural embeddings of the
documents (passages) and fuse them together before feeding them to the language
model. We evaluate our model extensively on various scientific benchmarks that
include science question-answering and scientific document classification
tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that structure-aware retrieval improves
retrieving more coherent, faithful and contextually relevant passages, while
showing a comparable performance in the overall accuracy.",2023-11-21,2023,2023-11,chemistry
"Everybody Needs a Little HELP: Explaining Graphs via Hierarchical
  Concepts","Graph neural networks (GNNs) have led to major breakthroughs in a variety of
domains such as drug discovery, social network analysis, and travel time
estimation. However, they lack interpretability which hinders human trust and
thereby deployment to settings with high-stakes decisions. A line of
interpretable methods approach this by discovering a small set of relevant
concepts as subgraphs in the last GNN layer that together explain the
prediction. This can yield oversimplified explanations, failing to explain the
interaction between GNN layers. To address this oversight, we provide HELP
(Hierarchical Explainable Latent Pooling), a novel, inherently interpretable
graph pooling approach that reveals how concepts from different GNN layers
compose to new ones in later steps. HELP is more than 1-WL expressive and is
the first non-spectral, end-to-end-learnable, hierarchical graph pooling method
that can learn to pool a variable number of arbitrary connected components. We
empirically demonstrate that it performs on-par with standard GCNs and popular
pooling methods in terms of accuracy while yielding explanations that are
aligned with expert knowledge in the domains of chemistry and social networks.
In addition to a qualitative analysis, we employ concept completeness scores as
well as concept conformity, a novel metric to measure the noise in discovered
concepts, quantitatively verifying that the discovered concepts are
significantly easier to fully understand than those from previous work. Our
work represents a first step towards an understanding of graph neural networks
that goes beyond a set of concepts from the final layer and instead explains
the complex interplay of concepts on different levels.",2023-11-25,2023,2023-11,chemistry
"Transforming organic chemistry research paradigms: moving from manual

"Meta-Diversity Search in Complex Systems, A Recipe for Artificial
  Open-Endedness ?","Can we build an artificial system that would be able to generate endless
surprises if ran ""forever"" in Minecraft? While there is not a single path
toward solving that grand challenge, this article presents what we believe to
be some working ingredients for the endless generation of novel increasingly
complex artifacts in Minecraft. Our framework for an open-ended system includes
two components: a complex system used to recursively grow and complexify
artifacts over time, and a discovery algorithm that leverages the concept of
meta-diversity search. Since complex systems have shown to enable the emergence
of considerable complexity from set of simple rules, we believe them to be
great candidates to generate all sort of artifacts in Minecraft. Yet, the space
of possible artifacts that can be generated by these systems is often unknown,
challenging to characterize and explore. Therefore automating the long-term
discovery of novel and increasingly complex artifacts in these systems is an
exciting research field. To approach these challenges, we formulate the problem
of meta-diversity search where an artificial ""discovery assistant""
incrementally learns a diverse set of representations to characterize behaviors
and searches to discover diverse patterns within each of them. A successful
discovery assistant should continuously seek for novel sources of diversities
while being able to quickly specialize the search toward a new unknown type of
diversity. To implement those ideas in the Minecraft environment, we simulate
an artificial ""chemistry"" system based on Lenia continuous cellular automaton
for generating artifacts, as well as an artificial ""discovery assistant""
(called Holmes) for the artifact-discovery process. Holmes incrementally learns
a hierarchy of modular representations to characterize divergent sources of
diversity and uses a goal-based intrinsically-motivated exploration as the
diversity search strategy.",2023-12-01,2023,2023-12,chemistry
"AdsorbRL: Deep Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning for Inverse

catalysts for low-emissions technologies. Recent advances in Machine Learning
for quantum chemistry drastically accelerate the computation of catalytic
activity descriptors such as adsorption energies. Here we introduce AdsorbRL, a
Deep Reinforcement Learning agent aiming to identify potential catalysts given
a multi-objective binding energy target, trained using offline learning on the
Open Catalyst 2020 and Materials Project data sets. We experiment with Deep
Q-Network agents to traverse the space of all ~160,000 possible unary, binary
and ternary compounds of 55 chemical elements, with very sparse rewards based
on adsorption energy known for only between 2,000 and 3,000 catalysts per
adsorbate. To constrain the actions space, we introduce Random Edge Traversal
and train a single-objective DQN agent on the known states subgraph, which we
find strengthens target binding energy by an average of 4.1 eV. We extend this
approach to multi-objective, goal-conditioned learning, and train a DQN agent
to identify materials with the highest (respectively lowest) adsorption
energies for multiple simultaneous target adsorbates. We experiment with
Objective Sub-Sampling, a novel training scheme aimed at encouraging
exploration in the multi-objective setup, and demonstrate simultaneous
adsorption energy improvement across all target adsorbates, by an average of
0.8 eV. Overall, our results suggest strong potential for Deep Reinforcement
Learning applied to the inverse catalysts design problem.",2023-12-04,2023,2023-12,chemistry

are capable of autonomously learning intrinsic data features, thereby
transcending the limitations of traditional experience to a certain extent.
Here, we unveil previously unreported information characteristics pertaining to
different frequencies emerged during our work on predicting the terahertz

"Molecule Joint Auto-Encoding: Trajectory Pretraining with 2D and 3D
  Diffusion","Recently, artificial intelligence for drug discovery has raised increasing
interest in both machine learning and chemistry domains. The fundamental
building block for drug discovery is molecule geometry and thus, the molecule's
geometrical representation is the main bottleneck to better utilize machine
learning techniques for drug discovery. In this work, we propose a pretraining
method for molecule joint auto-encoding (MoleculeJAE). MoleculeJAE can learn
both the 2D bond (topology) and 3D conformation (geometry) information, and a
diffusion process model is applied to mimic the augmented trajectories of such
two modalities, based on which, MoleculeJAE will learn the inherent chemical
structure in a self-supervised manner. Thus, the pretrained geometrical

MatterGen: a generative model for inorganic materials design,"The design of functional materials with desired properties is essential in
driving technological advances in areas like energy storage, catalysis, and
carbon capture. Generative models provide a new paradigm for materials design
by directly generating entirely novel materials given desired property
constraints. Despite recent progress, current generative models have low
success rate in proposing stable crystals, or can only satisfy a very limited
set of property constraints. Here, we present MatterGen, a model that generates
stable, diverse inorganic materials across the periodic table and can further
be fine-tuned to steer the generation towards a broad range of property
constraints. To enable this, we introduce a new diffusion-based generative
process that produces crystalline structures by gradually refining atom types,
coordinates, and the periodic lattice. We further introduce adapter modules to
enable fine-tuning towards any given property constraints with a labeled
dataset. Compared to prior generative models, structures produced by MatterGen
are more than twice as likely to be novel and stable, and more than 15 times
closer to the local energy minimum. After fine-tuning, MatterGen successfully
generates stable, novel materials with desired chemistry, symmetry, as well as
mechanical, electronic and magnetic properties. Finally, we demonstrate
multi-property materials design capabilities by proposing structures that have
both high magnetic density and a chemical composition with low supply-chain
risk. We believe that the quality of generated materials and the breadth of
MatterGen's capabilities represent a major advancement towards creating a
universal generative model for materials design.",2023-12-06,2023,2023-12,chemistry

TextReact retrieves text descriptions relevant for a given chemical reaction,
and then aligns them with the molecular representation of the reaction. This
alignment is enhanced via an auxiliary masked LM objective incorporated in the
predictor training. We empirically validate the framework on two chemistry
tasks: reaction condition recommendation and one-step retrosynthesis. By
leveraging text retrieval, TextReact significantly outperforms state-of-the-art

approach involved an automated process of converting 346 scholarly articles
into 6240 images, which represents a benchmark dataset in this task, followed
by deploying GPT-4V to categorize and analyze these images using natural
language prompts. This methodology enabled GPT-4V to accurately identify and
interpret key plots integral to MOF characterization, such as nitrogen

recall above 93%. The model's proficiency in extracting critical information
from these plots not only underscores its capability in data mining but also
highlights its potential in aiding the creation of comprehensive digital

"Using Think-Aloud Data to Understand Relations between Self-Regulation
  Cycle Characteristics and Student Performance in Intelligent Tutoring Systems","Numerous studies demonstrate the importance of self-regulation during
learning by problem-solving. Recent work in learning analytics has largely
examined students' use of SRL concerning overall learning gains. Limited
research has related SRL to in-the-moment performance differences among
learners. The present study investigates SRL behaviors in relationship to
learners' moment-by-moment performance while working with intelligent tutoring
systems for stoichiometry chemistry. We demonstrate the feasibility of labeling
SRL behaviors based on AI-generated think-aloud transcripts, identifying the
presence or absence of four SRL categories (processing information, planning,
enacting, and realizing errors) in each utterance. Using the SRL codes, we
conducted regression analyses to examine how the use of SRL in terms of
presence, frequency, cyclical characteristics, and recency relate to student
performance on subsequent steps in multi-step problems. A model considering
students' SRL cycle characteristics outperformed a model only using
in-the-moment SRL assessment. In line with theoretical predictions, students'
actions during earlier, process-heavy stages of SRL cycles exhibited lower
moment-by-moment correctness during problem-solving than later SRL cycle
stages. We discuss system re-design opportunities to add SRL support during

Drivers and Barriers of AI Adoption and Use in Scientific Research,"New technologies have the power to revolutionize science. It has happened in
the past and is happening again with the emergence of new computational tools,
such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. Despite the documented
impact of these technologies, there remains a significant gap in understanding
the process of their adoption within the scientific community. In this paper,
we draw on theories of scientific and technical human capital to study the
integration of AI in scientific research, focusing on the human capital of

experienced AI scientists and early-career researchers; they come from
institutions with high citation impact and a relatively strong publication
history on AI. The access to computing resources only matters for a few

Enabling Accelerators for Graph Computing,"The advent of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has revolutionized the field of
machine learning, offering a novel paradigm for learning on graph-structured

relationships and dependencies inherent in graph data, making them particularly
suited for a wide range of applications including social network analysis,
molecular chemistry, and network security. GNNs, with their unique structure
and operation, present new computational challenges compared to conventional
neural networks. This requires comprehensive benchmarking and a thorough
characterization of GNNs to obtain insight into their computational
requirements and to identify potential performance bottlenecks. In this thesis,
we aim to develop a better understanding of how GNNs interact with the
underlying hardware and will leverage this knowledge as we design specialized

Continuous-time Graph Representation with Sequential Survival Process,"Over the past two decades, there has been a tremendous increase in the growth
of representation learning methods for graphs, with numerous applications
across various fields, including bioinformatics, chemistry, and the social
sciences. However, current dynamic network approaches focus on discrete-time
networks or treat links in continuous-time networks as instantaneous events.
Therefore, these approaches have limitations in capturing the persistence or
absence of links that continuously emerge and disappear over time for
particular durations. To address this, we propose a novel stochastic process
relying on survival functions to model the durations of links and their
absences over time. This forms a generic new likelihood specification
explicitly accounting for intermittent edge-persistent networks, namely GraSSP:
Graph Representation with Sequential Survival Process. We apply the developed
framework to a recent continuous time dynamic latent distance model
characterizing network dynamics in terms of a sequence of piecewise linear
movements of nodes in latent space. We quantitatively assess the developed
framework in various downstream tasks, such as link prediction and network
completion, demonstrating that the developed modeling framework accounting for

"An integrated framework for accelerating reactive flow simulation using
  GPU and machine learning models","Recent progress in artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance

accelerating reactive flow simulations. In this study, we introduce an
open-source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) framework that integrates the
strengths of machine learning (ML) and graphics processing unit (GPU) to
demonstrate their combined capability. Within this framework, all computational
operations are solely executed on GPU, including ML-accelerated chemistry
integration, fully-implicit solving of PDEs, and computation of thermal and
transport properties, thereby eliminating the CPU-GPU memory copy overhead.
Optimisations both within the kernel functions and during the kernel launch
process are conducted to enhance computational performance. Strategies such as
static data reorganisation and dynamic data allocation are adopted to reduce
the GPU memory footprint. The computational performance is evaluated in two
turbulent flame benchmarks using quasi-DNS and LES modelling, respectively.
Remarkably, while maintaining a similar level of accuracy to the conventional
CPU/CVODE-based solver, the GPU/ML-accelerated approach shows an overall
speedup of over two orders of magnitude for both cases. This result highlights
that high-fidelity turbulent combustion simulation with finite-rate chemistry

"Diffusion-Driven Generative Framework for Molecular Conformation
  Prediction","The task of deducing three-dimensional molecular configurations from their
two-dimensional graph representations holds paramount importance in the fields
of computational chemistry and pharmaceutical development. The rapid
advancement of machine learning, particularly within the domain of deep
generative networks, has revolutionized the precision of predictive modeling in
this context. Traditional approaches often adopt a two-step strategy: initially
estimating interatomic distances and subsequently refining the spatial
molecular structure by solving a distance geometry problem. However, this
sequential approach occasionally falls short in accurately capturing the
intricacies of local atomic arrangements, thereby compromising the fidelity of
the resulting structural models. Addressing these limitations, this research
introduces a cutting-edge generative framework named DDGF. This framework is
grounded in the principles of diffusion observed in classical non-equilibrium
thermodynamics. DDGF views atoms as discrete entities and excels in guiding the
reversal of diffusion, transforming a distribution of stochastic noise back
into coherent molecular structures through a process akin to a Markov chain.
This transformation commences with the initial representation of a molecular
graph in an abstract latent space, culminating in the realization of
three-dimensional structures via a sophisticated bilevel optimization scheme
meticulously tailored to meet the specific requirements of the task. One of the
formidable challenges in this modeling endeavor involves preserving
roto-translational invariance to ensure that the generated molecular
conformations adhere to the laws of physics. Extensive experimental evaluations
confirm the efficacy of the proposed DDGF in comparison to state-of-the-art
methods.",2023-12-22,2023,2023-12,chemistry
"Towards End-to-End Structure Solutions from Information-Compromised

for example, due to orientational averaging of grains, finite size effects due
to nanostructure, and mixed signals due to sample heterogeneity. Understanding
the structure property relationships in such situations is, if anything, more
important and insightful, yet we do not have robust approaches for
accomplishing it. In principle, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)
are promising approaches since they augment information in the degraded input
signal with prior knowledge learned from large databases of already known
structures. Here we present a novel ML approach, a variational query-based
multi-branch deep neural network that has the promise to be a robust but
general tool to address this problem end-to-end. We demonstrate the approach on
computed powder x-ray diffraction (PXRD), along with partial chemical
composition information, as input. We choose as a structural representation a
modified electron density we call the Cartesian mapped electron density (CMED),
that straightforwardly allows our ML model to learn material structures across
different chemistries, symmetries and crystal systems. When evaluated on
theoretically simulated data for the cubic and trigonal crystal systems, the
system achieves up to $93.4\%$ average similarity with the ground truth on
unseen materials, both with known and partially-known chemical composition
information, showing great promise for successful structure solution even from
degraded and incomplete input data.",2023-12-23,2023,2023-12,chemistry
"Generating High-Precision Force Fields for Molecular Dynamics
  Simulations to Study Chemical Reaction Mechanisms using Molecular
  Configuration Transformer","Theoretical studies on chemical reaction mechanisms have been crucial in
organic chemistry. Traditionally, calculating the manually constructed
molecular conformations of transition states for chemical reactions using
quantum chemical calculations is the most commonly used method. However, this
way is heavily dependent on individual experience and chemical intuition. In
our previous study, we proposed a research paradigm that uses enhanced sampling
in molecular dynamics simulations to study chemical reactions. This approach
can directly simulate the entire process of a chemical reaction. However, the
computational speed limits the use of high-precision potential energy functions
for simulations. To address this issue, we present a scheme for training
high-precision force fields for molecular modeling using a previously developed
graph-neural-network-based molecular model, molecular configuration
transformer. This potential energy function allows for highly accurate
simulations at a low computational cost, leading to more precise calculations
of the mechanism of chemical reactions. We applied this approach to study a
Claisen rearrangement reaction and a Carbonyl insertion reaction catalyzed by
Manganese.",2023-12-31,2023,2023-12,chemistry
GraphGPT: Generative Pre-trained Graph Eulerian Transformer,"We introduceGraphGPT, a novel self-supervised generative pre-trained model
for graph learning based on the Graph Eulerian Transformer (GET). First, we
propose GET, which combines a standard transformer encoder or decoder
architecture with an innovative graph-to-sequence transformation method. This
method converts graphs or sampled subgraphs into sequences of tokens
representing nodes, edges, and attributes in a reversible manner using Eulerian
paths. We pre-train GET using either of the two self-supervised tasks:
next-token prediction (NTP) and scheduled masked-token prediction (SMTP). The
pre-trained model is then fine-tuned for downstream tasks such as graph-,
edge-, and node-level prediction. Despite its simplicity, GraphGPT achieves
performance comparable to or surpassing state-of-the-art methods on multiple
large-scale Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) datasets. It demonstrates exceptional
results on the molecular property prediction dataset PCQM4Mv2 and the
protein-protein interaction dataset ogbl-ppa. Notably, generative pre-training
enables scaling GraphGPT to 2 billion parameters while maintaining performance
gains - a breakthrough that overcomes the scalability limitations of
traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and prior graph transformers (GTs). To
advance research in graph foundation models and facilitate scientific discovery
in chemistry, materials science, and related fields, we will release the source
code (https://github.com/alibaba/graph-gpt) and pre-trained checkpoints.",2023-12-31,2023,2023-12,chemistry
On the Expressive Power of Graph Neural Networks,"The study of Graph Neural Networks has received considerable interest in the
past few years. By extending deep learning to graph-structured data, GNNs can
solve a diverse set of tasks in fields including social science, chemistry, and
medicine. The development of GNN architectures has largely been focused on
improving empirical performance on tasks like node or graph classification.
However, a line of recent work has instead sought to find GNN architectures
that have desirable theoretical properties - by studying their expressive power
and designing architectures that maximize this expressiveness.
  While there is no consensus on the best way to define the expressiveness of a
GNN, it can be viewed from several well-motivated perspectives. Perhaps the
most natural approach is to study the universal approximation properties of
GNNs, much in the way that this has been studied extensively for MLPs. Another
direction focuses on the extent to which GNNs can distinguish between different
graph structures, relating this to the graph isomorphism test. Besides, a GNN's
ability to compute graph properties such as graph moments has been suggested as
another form of expressiveness. All of these different definitions are
complementary and have yielded different recommendations for GNN architecture
choices. In this paper, we would like to give an overview of the notion of
""expressive power"" of GNNs and provide some valuable insights regarding the
design choices of GNNs.",2024-01-03,2024,2024-01,chemistry
"ORGANA: A Robotic Assistant for Automated Chemistry Experimentation and
  Characterization","Chemistry experiments can be resource- and labor-intensive, often requiring
manual tasks like polishing electrodes in electrochemistry. Traditional lab
automation infrastructure faces challenges adapting to new experiments. To
address this, we introduce ORGANA, an assistive robotic system that automates
diverse chemistry experiments using decision-making and perception tools. It
makes decisions with chemists in the loop to control robots and lab devices.
ORGANA interacts with chemists using Large Language Models (LLMs) to derive

ChemDFM: A Large Language Foundation Model for Chemistry,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has played an increasingly important role in
chemical research. However, most models currently used in chemistry are
specialist models that require training and tuning for specific tasks. A more
generic and efficient solution would be an AI model that could address many
tasks and support free-form dialogue in the broad field of chemistry. In its
utmost form, such a generalist AI chemist could be referred to as Chemical
General Intelligence. Large language models (LLMs) have recently logged
tremendous success in the general domain of natural language processing,
showing emerging task generalization and free-form dialogue capabilities.
However, domain knowledge of chemistry is largely missing when training
general-domain LLMs. The lack of such knowledge greatly hinders the performance
of generalist LLMs in the field of chemistry. To this end, we develop ChemDFM,
a pioneering LLM for chemistry trained on 34B tokens from chemical literature
and textbooks, and fine-tuned using 2.7M instructions. As a result, it can
understand and reason with chemical knowledge in free-form dialogue.
Quantitative evaluations show that ChemDFM significantly surpasses most
representative open-source LLMs. It outperforms GPT-4 on a great portion of
chemical tasks, despite the substantial size difference. We have open-sourced
the inference codes, evaluation datasets, and model weights of ChemDFM on

"LLaMP: Large Language Model Made Powerful for High-fidelity Materials
  Knowledge Retrieval and Distillation","Reducing hallucination of Large Language Models (LLMs) is imperative for use
in the sciences, where reliability and reproducibility are crucial. However,
LLMs inherently lack long-term memory, making it a nontrivial, ad hoc, and
inevitably biased task to fine-tune them on domain-specific literature and
data. Here we introduce LLaMP, a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) framework of hierarchical reasoning-and-acting (ReAct) agents that can
dynamically and recursively interact with computational and experimental data
on Materials Project (MP) and run atomistic simulations via high-throughput
workflow interface. Without fine-tuning, LLaMP demonstrates strong tool usage
ability to comprehend and integrate various modalities of materials science
concepts, fetch relevant data stores on the fly, process higher-order data
(such as crystal structure and elastic tensor), and streamline complex tasks in
computational materials and chemistry. We propose a simple metric combining
uncertainty and confidence estimates to evaluate the self-consistency of
responses by LLaMP and vanilla LLMs. Our benchmark shows that LLaMP effectively
mitigates the intrinsic bias in LLMs, counteracting the errors on bulk moduli,
electronic bandgaps, and formation energies that seem to derive from mixed data
sources. We also demonstrate LLaMP's capability to edit crystal structures and
run annealing molecular dynamics simulations using pre-trained machine-learning
force fields. The framework offers an intuitive and nearly hallucination-free
approach to exploring and scaling materials informatics, and establishes a
pathway for knowledge distillation and fine-tuning other language models. Code

specialized domain knowledge. This paper provides a thorough exploration of the
nuanced methodologies employed in integrating LLMs into the field of chemistry,
delving into the complexities and innovations at this interdisciplinary
juncture. Specifically, our analysis begins with examining how molecular
information is fed into LLMs through various representation and tokenization
methods. We then categorize chemical LLMs into three distinct groups based on
the domain and modality of their input data, and discuss approaches for
integrating these inputs for LLMs. Furthermore, this paper delves into the
pretraining objectives with adaptations to chemical LLMs. After that, we
explore the diverse applications of LLMs in chemistry, including novel
paradigms for their application in chemistry tasks. Finally, we identify
promising research directions, including further integration with chemical

"Curriculum reinforcement learning for quantum architecture search under
  hardware errors","The key challenge in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era is finding
useful circuits compatible with current device limitations. Variational quantum
algorithms (VQAs) offer a potential solution by fixing the circuit architecture
and optimizing individual gate parameters in an external loop. However,
parameter optimization can become intractable, and the overall performance of
the algorithm depends heavily on the initially chosen circuit architecture.
Several quantum architecture search (QAS) algorithms have been developed to
design useful circuit architectures automatically. In the case of parameter
optimization alone, noise effects have been observed to dramatically influence
the performance of the optimizer and final outcomes, which is a key line of
study. However, the effects of noise on the architecture search, which could be
just as critical, are poorly understood. This work addresses this gap by
introducing a curriculum-based reinforcement learning QAS (CRLQAS) algorithm
designed to tackle challenges in realistic VQA deployment. The algorithm
incorporates (i) a 3D architecture encoding and restrictions on environment
dynamics to explore the search space of possible circuits efficiently, (ii) an
episode halting scheme to steer the agent to find shorter circuits, and (iii) a
novel variant of simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation as an
optimizer for faster convergence. To facilitate studies, we developed an
optimized simulator for our algorithm, significantly improving computational
efficiency in simulating noisy quantum circuits by employing the Pauli-transfer
matrix formalism in the Pauli-Liouville basis. Numerical experiments focusing
on quantum chemistry tasks demonstrate that CRLQAS outperforms existing QAS
algorithms across several metrics in both noiseless and noisy environments.",2024-02-05,2024,2024-02,chemistry

"cecilia: A Machine Learning-Based Pipeline for Measuring Metal
  Abundances of Helium-rich Polluted White Dwarfs","Over the past several decades, conventional spectral analysis techniques of
polluted white dwarfs have become powerful tools to learn about the geology and
chemistry of extrasolar bodies. Despite their proven capabilities and extensive
legacy of scientific discoveries, these techniques are however still limited by
their manual, time-intensive, and iterative nature. As a result, they are
susceptible to human errors and are difficult to scale up to population-wide
studies of metal pollution. This paper seeks to address this problem by
presenting cecilia, the first Machine Learning (ML)-powered spectral modeling
code designed to measure the metal abundances of intermediate-temperature
(10,000$\leq T_{\rm eff} \leq$20,000 K), Helium-rich polluted white dwarfs.
Trained with more than 22,000 randomly drawn atmosphere models and stellar
parameters, our pipeline aims to overcome the limitations of classical methods
by replacing the generation of synthetic spectra from computationally expensive
codes and uniformly spaced model grids, with a fast, automated, and efficient
neural-network-based interpolator. More specifically, cecilia combines
state-of-the-art atmosphere models, powerful artificial intelligence tools, and
robust statistical techniques to rapidly generate synthetic spectra of polluted
white dwarfs in high-dimensional space, and enable accurate ($\lesssim$0.1 dex)
and simultaneous measurements of 14 stellar parameters -- including 11
elemental abundances -- from real spectroscopic observations. As massively
multiplexed astronomical surveys begin scientific operations, cecilia's
performance has the potential to unlock large-scale studies of extrasolar
geochemistry and propel the field of white dwarf science into the era of Big
Data. In doing so, we aspire to uncover new statistical insights that were
previously impractical with traditional white dwarf characterisation
techniques.",2024-02-07,2024,2024-02,chemistry
ChemLLM: A Chemical Large Language Model,"Large language models (LLMs) have made impressive progress in chemistry
applications. However, the community lacks an LLM specifically designed for

there is an absence of objective and fair benchmark that encompass most

"Revealing the Relationship Between Publication Bias and Chemical
  Reactivity with Contrastive Learning","A synthetic method's substrate tolerance and generality are often showcased
in a ""substrate scope"" table. However, substrate selection exhibits a
frequently discussed publication bias: unsuccessful experiments or low-yielding
results are rarely reported. In this work, we explore more deeply the
relationship between such publication bias and chemical reactivity beyond the
simple analysis of yield distributions using a novel neural network training
strategy, substrate scope contrastive learning. By treating reported substrates
as positive samples and non-reported substrates as negative samples, our
contrastive learning strategy teaches a model to group molecules within a
numerical embedding space, based on historical trends in published substrate
scope tables. Training on 20,798 aryl halides in the CAS Content
Collection$^{\text{TM}}$, spanning thousands of publications from 2010-2015, we
demonstrate that the learned embeddings exhibit a correlation with physical
organic reactivity descriptors through both intuitive visualizations and
quantitative regression analyses. Additionally, these embeddings are applicable
to various reaction modeling tasks like yield prediction and regioselectivity
prediction, underscoring the potential to use historical reaction data as a
pre-training task. This work not only presents a chemistry-specific machine

"Contextual Molecule Representation Learning from Chemical Reaction
  Knowledge","In recent years, self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful tool to
harness abundant unlabelled data for representation learning and has been
broadly adopted in diverse areas. However, when applied to molecular
representation learning (MRL), prevailing techniques such as masked sub-unit
reconstruction often fall short, due to the high degree of freedom in the
possible combinations of atoms within molecules, which brings insurmountable
complexity to the masking-reconstruction paradigm. To tackle this challenge, we
introduce REMO, a self-supervised learning framework that takes advantage of
well-defined atom-combination rules in common chemistry. Specifically, REMO
pre-trains graph/Transformer encoders on 1.7 million known chemical reactions
in the literature. We propose two pre-training objectives: Masked Reaction
Centre Reconstruction (MRCR) and Reaction Centre Identification (RCI). REMO
offers a novel solution to MRL by exploiting the underlying shared patterns in
chemical reactions as \textit{context} for pre-training, which effectively
infers meaningful representations of common chemistry knowledge. Such
contextual representations can then be utilized to support diverse downstream
molecular tasks with minimum finetuning, such as affinity prediction and
drug-drug interaction prediction. Extensive experimental results on
MoleculeACE, ACNet, drug-drug interaction (DDI), and reaction type
classification show that across all tested downstream tasks, REMO outperforms
the standard baseline of single-molecule masked modeling used in current MRL.

demonstrated their capabilities for reliable protein design. However, previous
models are limited to the unconditional generation of protein sequences and
lack the controllable generation ability that is vital to biological tasks. In
this work, we propose TaxDiff, a taxonomic-guided diffusion model for
controllable protein sequence generation that combines biological species
information with the generative capabilities of diffusion models to generate
structurally stable proteins within the sequence space. Specifically, taxonomic
control information is inserted into each layer of the transformer block to
achieve fine-grained control. The combination of global and local attention
ensures the sequence consistency and structural foldability of
taxonomic-specific proteins. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TaxDiff can
consistently achieve better performance on multiple protein sequence generation
benchmarks in both taxonomic-guided controllable generation and unconditional

"TransPeakNet: Solvent-Aware 2D NMR Prediction via Multi-Task
  Pre-Training and Unsupervised Learning","Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is essential for revealing
molecular structure, electronic environment, and dynamics. Accurate NMR shift
prediction allows researchers to validate structures by comparing predicted and
observed shifts. While Machine Learning (ML) has improved one-dimensional (1D)
NMR shift prediction, predicting 2D NMR remains challenging due to limited
annotated data. To address this, we introduce an unsupervised training
framework for predicting cross-peaks in 2D NMR, specifically Heteronuclear
Single Quantum Coherence (HSQC).Our approach pretrains an ML model on an
annotated 1D dataset of 1H and 13C shifts, then finetunes it in an unsupervised
manner using unlabeled HSQC data, which simultaneously generates cross-peak
annotations. Our model also adjusts for solvent effects. Evaluation on 479
expert-annotated HSQC spectra demonstrates our model's superiority over
traditional methods (ChemDraw and Mestrenova), achieving Mean Absolute Errors
(MAEs) of 2.05 ppm and 0.165 ppm for 13C shifts and 1H shifts respectively. Our
algorithmic annotations show a 95.21% concordance with experts' assignments,
underscoring the approach's potential for structural elucidation in fields like
organic chemistry, pharmaceuticals, and natural products.",2024-03-17,2024,2024-03,chemistry
"PEaCE: A Chemistry-Oriented Dataset for Optical Character Recognition on
  Scientific Documents","Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is an established task with the objective
of identifying the text present in an image. While many off-the-shelf OCR
models exist, they are often trained for either scientific (e.g., formulae) or
generic printed English text. Extracting text from chemistry publications
requires an OCR model that is capable in both realms. Nougat, a recent tool,
exhibits strong ability to parse academic documents, but is unable to parse
tables in PubMed articles, which comprises a significant part of the academic
community and is the focus of this work. To mitigate this gap, we present the
Printed English and Chemical Equations (PEaCE) dataset, containing both
synthetic and real-world records, and evaluate the efficacy of
transformer-based OCR models when trained on this resource. Given that
real-world records contain artifacts not present in synthetic records, we
propose transformations that mimic such qualities. We perform a suite of
experiments to explore the impact of patch size, multi-domain training, and our
proposed transformations, ultimately finding that models with a small patch
size trained on multiple domains using the proposed transformations yield the
best performance. Our dataset and code is available at

"On machine learning analysis of atomic force microscopy images for image
  classification, sample surface recognition","Atomic force microscopy (AFM or SPM) imaging is one of the best matches with
machine learning (ML) analysis among microscopy techniques. The digital format
of AFM images allows for direct utilization in ML algorithms without the need
for additional processing. Additionally, AFM enables the simultaneous imaging
of distributions of over a dozen different physicochemical properties of sample
surfaces, a process known as multidimensional imaging. While this wealth of
information can be challenging to analyze using traditional methods, ML
provides a seamless approach to this task. However, the relatively slow speed
of AFM imaging poses a challenge in applying deep learning methods broadly used
in image recognition. This Prospective is focused on ML
recognition/classification when using a relatively small number of AFM images,
small database. We discuss ML methods other than popular deep-learning neural
networks. The described approach has already been successfully used to analyze
and classify the surfaces of biological cells. It can be applied to recognize
medical images, specific material processing, in forensic studies, even to
identify the authenticity of arts. A general template for ML analysis specific
to AFM is suggested, with a specific example of the identification of cell
phenotype. Special attention is given to the analysis of the statistical
significance of the obtained results, an important feature that is often
overlooked in papers dealing with machine learning. A simple method for finding
statistical significance is also described.",2024-03-24,2024,2024-03,chemistry
Are large language models superhuman chemists?,"Large language models (LLMs) have gained widespread interest due to their
ability to process human language and perform tasks on which they have not been
explicitly trained.
  However, we possess only a limited systematic understanding of the chemical
capabilities of LLMs, which would be required to improve models and mitigate
potential harm. Here, we introduce ""ChemBench,"" an automated framework for
evaluating the chemical knowledge and reasoning abilities of state-of-the-art
LLMs against the expertise of chemists.
  We curated more than 2,700 question-answer pairs, evaluated leading open- and
closed-source LLMs, and found that the best models outperformed the best human
chemists in our study on average. However, the models struggle with some basic
tasks and provide overconfident predictions.
  These findings reveal LLMs' impressive chemical capabilities while
emphasizing the need for further research to improve their safety and
usefulness. They also suggest adapting chemistry education and show the value
of benchmarking frameworks for evaluating LLMs in specific domains.",2024-04-01,2024,2024-04,chemistry
"Graph Reinforcement Learning for Combinatorial Optimization: A Survey
  and Unifying Perspective","Graphs are a natural representation for systems based on relations between
connected entities. Combinatorial optimization problems, which arise when
considering an objective function related to a process of interest on discrete
structures, are often challenging due to the rapid growth of the solution
space. The trial-and-error paradigm of Reinforcement Learning has recently
emerged as a promising alternative to traditional methods, such as exact
algorithms and (meta)heuristics, for discovering better decision-making
strategies in a variety of disciplines including chemistry, computer science,
and statistics. Despite the fact that they arose in markedly different fields,
these techniques share significant commonalities. Therefore, we set out to
synthesize this work in a unifying perspective that we term Graph Reinforcement
Learning, interpreting it as a constructive decision-making method for graph
problems. After covering the relevant technical background, we review works
along the dividing line of whether the goal is to optimize graph structure
given a process of interest, or to optimize the outcome of the process itself
under fixed graph structure. Finally, we discuss the common challenges facing
the field and open research questions. In contrast with other surveys, the
present work focuses on non-canonical graph problems for which performant
algorithms are typically not known and Reinforcement Learning is able to
provide efficient and effective solutions.",2024-04-09,2024,2024-04,chemistry
"Shape Arithmetic Expressions: Advancing Scientific Discovery Beyond
  Closed-Form Equations","Symbolic regression has excelled in uncovering equations from physics,
chemistry, biology, and related disciplines. However, its effectiveness becomes
less certain when applied to experimental data lacking inherent closed-form
expressions. Empirically derived relationships, such as entire stress-strain
curves, may defy concise closed-form representation, compelling us to explore
more adaptive modeling approaches that balance flexibility with
interpretability. In our pursuit, we turn to Generalized Additive Models
(GAMs), a widely used class of models known for their versatility across
various domains. Although GAMs can capture non-linear relationships between
variables and targets, they cannot capture intricate feature interactions. In
this work, we investigate both of these challenges and propose a novel class of
models, Shape Arithmetic Expressions (SHAREs), that fuses GAM's flexible shape
functions with the complex feature interactions found in mathematical
expressions. SHAREs also provide a unifying framework for both of these
approaches. We also design a set of rules for constructing SHAREs that
guarantee transparency of the found expressions beyond the standard constraints
based on the model's size.",2024-04-15,2024,2024-04,chemistry
"Integrating Chemistry Knowledge in Large Language Models via Prompt
  Engineering","This paper presents a study on the integration of domain-specific knowledge
in prompt engineering to enhance the performance of large language models

chemical domains.The proposed domain-knowledge embedded prompt engineering
method outperforms traditional prompt engineering strategies on various
metrics, including capability, accuracy, F1 score, and hallucination drop. The
effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through case studies on complex
materials including the MacMillan catalyst, paclitaxel, and lithium cobalt
oxide. The results suggest that domain-knowledge prompts can guide LLMs to
generate more accurate and relevant responses, highlighting the potential of
LLMs as powerful tools for scientific discovery and innovation when equipped
with domain-specific prompts. The study also discusses limitations and future
directions for domain-specific prompt engineering development.",2024-04-22,2024,2024-04,chemistry
"Delayed Bottlenecking: Alleviating Forgetting in Pre-trained Graph
  Neural Networks","Pre-training GNNs to extract transferable knowledge and apply it to
downstream tasks has become the de facto standard of graph representation
learning. Recent works focused on designing self-supervised pre-training tasks
to extract useful and universal transferable knowledge from large-scale
unlabeled data. However, they have to face an inevitable question: traditional
pre-training strategies that aim at extracting useful information about
pre-training tasks, may not extract all useful information about the downstream
task. In this paper, we reexamine the pre-training process within traditional
pre-training and fine-tuning frameworks from the perspective of Information
Bottleneck (IB) and confirm that the forgetting phenomenon in pre-training
phase may cause detrimental effects on downstream tasks. Therefore, we propose
a novel \underline{D}elayed \underline{B}ottlenecking \underline{P}re-training
(DBP) framework which maintains as much as possible mutual information between
latent representations and training data during pre-training phase by
suppressing the compression operation and delays the compression operation to
fine-tuning phase to make sure the compression can be guided with labeled
fine-tuning data and downstream tasks. To achieve this, we design two
information control objectives that can be directly optimized and further
integrate them into the actual model design. Extensive experiments on both
chemistry and biology domains demonstrate the effectiveness of DBP.",2024-04-23,2024,2024-04,chemistry
Global Concept Explanations for Graphs by Contrastive Learning,"Beyond improving trust and validating model fairness, xAI practices also have
the potential to recover valuable scientific insights in application domains
where little to no prior human intuition exists. To that end, we propose a
method to extract global concept explanations from the predictions of graph
neural networks to develop a deeper understanding of the tasks underlying
structure-property relationships. We identify concept explanations as dense
clusters in the self-explaining Megan models subgraph latent space. For each
concept, we optimize a representative prototype graph and optionally use GPT-4
to provide hypotheses about why each structure has a certain effect on the
prediction. We conduct computational experiments on synthetic and real-world
graph property prediction tasks. For the synthetic tasks we find that our
method correctly reproduces the structural rules by which they were created.
For real-world molecular property regression and classification tasks, we find
that our method rediscovers established rules of thumb. More specifically, our
results for molecular mutagenicity prediction indicate more fine-grained
resolution of structural details than existing explainability methods,
consistent with previous results from chemistry literature. Overall, our
results show promising capability to extract the underlying structure-property
relationships for complex graph property prediction tasks.",2024-04-25,2024,2024-04,chemistry
"Non-Spatial Hash Chemistry as a Minimalistic Open-Ended Evolutionary
  System","There is an increasing level of interest in open-endedness in the recent
literature of Artificial Life and Artificial Intelligence. We previously
proposed the cardinality leap of possibility spaces as a promising mechanism to
facilitate open-endedness in artificial evolutionary systems, and demonstrated
its effectiveness using Hash Chemistry, an artificial chemistry model that used
a hash function as a universal fitness evaluator. However, the spatial nature
of Hash Chemistry came with extensive computational costs involved in its
simulation, and the particle density limit imposed to prevent explosion of
computational costs prevented unbounded growth in complexity of higher-order
entities. To address these limitations, here we propose a simpler non-spatial
variant of Hash Chemistry in which spatial proximity of particles are
represented explicitly in the form of multisets. This model modification
achieved a significant reduction of computational costs in simulating the
model. Results of numerical simulations showed much more significant unbounded
growth in both maximal and average sizes of replicating higher-order entities
than the original model, demonstrating the effectiveness of this non-spatial
model as a minimalistic example of open-ended evolutionary systems.",2024-04-27,2024,2024-04,chemistry

CACTUS: Chemistry Agent Connecting Tool-Usage to Science,"Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential in various
domains, but they often lack the ability to access and reason over
domain-specific knowledge and tools. In this paper, we introduced CACTUS
(Chemistry Agent Connecting Tool-Usage to Science), an LLM-based agent that
integrates cheminformatics tools to enable advanced reasoning and
problem-solving in chemistry and molecular discovery. We evaluate the
performance of CACTUS using a diverse set of open-source LLMs, including
Gemma-7b, Falcon-7b, MPT-7b, Llama2-7b, and Mistral-7b, on a benchmark of
thousands of chemistry questions. Our results demonstrate that CACTUS
significantly outperforms baseline LLMs, with the Gemma-7b and Mistral-7b
models achieving the highest accuracy regardless of the prompting strategy
used. Moreover, we explore the impact of domain-specific prompting and hardware
configurations on model performance, highlighting the importance of prompt
engineering and the potential for deploying smaller models on consumer-grade
hardware without significant loss in accuracy. By combining the cognitive
capabilities of open-source LLMs with domain-specific tools, CACTUS can assist

"CVTGAD: Simplified Transformer with Cross-View Attention for
  Unsupervised Graph-level Anomaly Detection","Unsupervised graph-level anomaly detection (UGAD) has received remarkable
performance in various critical disciplines, such as chemistry analysis and
bioinformatics. Existing UGAD paradigms often adopt data augmentation
techniques to construct multiple views, and then employ different strategies to
obtain representations from different views for jointly conducting UGAD.
However, most previous works only considered the relationship between
nodes/graphs from a limited receptive field, resulting in some key structure
patterns and feature information being neglected. In addition, most existing
methods consider different views separately in a parallel manner, which is not
able to explore the inter-relationship across different views directly. Thus, a
method with a larger receptive field that can explore the inter-relationship
across different views directly is in need. In this paper, we propose a novel
Simplified Transformer with Cross-View Attention for Unsupervised Graph-level
Anomaly Detection, namely, CVTGAD. To increase the receptive field, we
construct a simplified transformer-based module, exploiting the relationship
between nodes/graphs from both intra-graph and inter-graph perspectives.
Furthermore, we design a cross-view attention mechanism to directly exploit the
view co-occurrence between different views, bridging the inter-view gap at node
level and graph level. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to
apply transformer and cross attention to UGAD, which realizes graph neural
network and transformer working collaboratively. Extensive experiments on 15
real-world datasets of 3 fields demonstrate the superiority of CVTGAD on the
UGAD task. The code is available at

their prediction accuracy cannot surpass that of DFT. In this work, we
developed a unified ML method for electronic structures of organic molecules

"Specialising and Analysing Instruction-Tuned and Byte-Level Language
  Models for Organic Reaction Prediction","Transformer-based encoder-decoder models have demonstrated impressive results
in chemical reaction prediction tasks. However, these models typically rely on
pretraining using tens of millions of unlabelled molecules, which can be
time-consuming and GPU-intensive. One of the central questions we aim to answer
in this work is: Can FlanT5 and ByT5, the encode-decoder models pretrained
solely on language data, be effectively specialised for organic reaction
prediction through task-specific fine-tuning? We conduct a systematic empirical
study on several key issues of the process, including tokenisation, the impact
of (SMILES-oriented) pretraining, fine-tuning sample efficiency, and decoding
algorithms at inference. Our key findings indicate that although being
pretrained only on language tasks, FlanT5 and ByT5 provide a solid foundation
to fine-tune for reaction prediction, and thus become `chemistry domain
compatible' in the process. This suggests that GPU-intensive and expensive
pretraining on a large dataset of unlabelled molecules may be useful yet not
essential to leverage the power of language models for chemistry. All our
models achieve comparable Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy although some variation
across different models does exist. Notably, tokenisation and vocabulary
trimming slightly affect final performance but can speed up training and
inference; The most efficient greedy decoding strategy is very competitive
while only marginal gains can be achieved from more sophisticated decoding
algorithms. In summary, we evaluate FlanT5 and ByT5 across several dimensions
and benchmark their impact on organic reaction prediction, which may guide more
effective use of these state-of-the-art language models for chemistry-related
tasks in the future.",2024-05-17,2024,2024-05,chemistry
Retro-prob: Retrosynthetic Planning Based on a Probabilistic Model,"Retrosynthesis is a fundamental but challenging task in organic chemistry,
with broad applications in fields such as drug design and synthesis. Given a
target molecule, the goal of retrosynthesis is to find out a series of
reactions which could be assembled into a synthetic route which starts from
purchasable molecules and ends at the target molecule. The uncertainty of
reactions used in retrosynthetic planning, which is caused by hallucinations of
backward models, has recently been noticed. In this paper we propose a succinct
probabilistic model to describe such uncertainty. Based on the model, we
propose a new retrosynthesis planning algorithm called retro-prob to maximize
the successful synthesis probability of target molecules, which acquires high
efficiency by utilizing the chain rule of derivatives. Experiments on the

"SE3Set: Harnessing equivariant hypergraph neural networks for molecular
  representation learning","In this paper, we develop SE3Set, an SE(3) equivariant hypergraph neural
network architecture tailored for advanced molecular representation learning.
Hypergraphs are not merely an extension of traditional graphs; they are pivotal
for modeling high-order relationships, a capability that conventional
equivariant graph-based methods lack due to their inherent limitations in
representing intricate many-body interactions. To achieve this, we first
construct hypergraphs via proposing a new fragmentation method that considers
both chemical and three-dimensional spatial information of molecular system. We
then design SE3Set, which incorporates equivariance into the hypergragh neural
network. This ensures that the learned molecular representations are invariant
to spatial transformations, thereby providing robustness essential for accurate
prediction of molecular properties. SE3Set has shown performance on par with
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models for small molecule datasets like QM9 and MD17.
It excels on the MD22 dataset, achieving a notable improvement of approximately
20% in accuracy across all molecules, which highlights the prevalence of

RLSF: Reinforcement Learning via Symbolic Feedback,"Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) is considered a standard
approach to fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs). However, such methods
often face limitations such as unsound black-box reward models, difficulties in
collecting human preference data, and the reliance on sparse scalar rewards.
These methods often fall short when applied to tasks that require complex
domain-specific understanding.
  To address these challenges, we propose a new fine-tuning paradigm we refer
to as Reinforcement Learning via Symbolic Feedback (RLSF), which aims to
improve domain-specific understanding of LLMs more effectively than traditional
reward signals. In the RLSF setting, the LLM being fine-tuned is considered an
RL agent, while the environment is allowed access to reasoning or domain
knowledge tools (e.g., solvers, provers, algebra systems, or knowledge bases).
Crucially, in RLSF, these reasoning tools can provide feedback to the LLMs via
poly-sized certificates (e.g., proofs), that characterize errors in the
LLM-generated object with respect to some correctness specification. As a
bonus, our RLSF approach does not require the reasoning systems we use to be
differentiable. The ability of RLSF-based fine-tuning to leverage
certificate-generating symbolic tools enables sound fine-grained (token-level)
reward signals to LLMs, and thus addresses the limitations of traditional
reward models mentioned above.
  Via extensive evaluations, we show that our RLSF-based fine-tuning of LLMs
outperforms traditional approaches on five different applications, namely,
program synthesis from natural language pseudo-code to programming language,
three chemistry tasks, and solving the Game of 24. A takeaway is that
fine-tuning via RLSF enables relatively smaller LLMs to significantly
outperform closed-source models that are orders of magnitude larger (e.g.,
GPT-4).",2024-05-26,2024,2024-05,chemistry
UniIF: Unified Molecule Inverse Folding,"Molecule inverse folding has been a long-standing challenge in chemistry and
biology, with the potential to revolutionize drug discovery and material
science. Despite specified models have been proposed for different small- or

initialization. 2) Model-Level: We introduce a geometric block attention
network, comprising a geometric interaction, interactive attention and virtual
long-term dependency modules, to capture the 3D interactions of all molecules.

Quo Vadis ChatGPT? From Large Language Models to Large Knowledge Models,"The startling success of ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) using
transformer-based generative neural network architecture in applications such
as natural language processing and image synthesis has many researchers excited
about potential opportunities in process systems engineering (PSE). The almost
human-like performance of LLMs in these areas is indeed very impressive,
surprising, and a major breakthrough. Their capabilities are very useful in
certain tasks, such as writing first drafts of documents, code writing

highly scientific domains as they cannot yet reason, plan, or explain due to
their lack of in-depth domain knowledge. This is a problem in domains such as
chemical engineering as they are governed by fundamental laws of physics and
chemistry (and biology), constitutive relations, and highly technical knowledge
about materials, processes, and systems. Although purely data-driven machine

pinpoints and assesses a wide array of flaws in MCQs. We first demonstrate the
discrepancy between commonly used automated evaluation metrics and the human

courses, we employed GPT-4 to generate KCs for multiple-choice questions (MCQs)
in Chemistry and E-Learning. We analyzed discrepancies between the KCs
generated by the Large Language Model (LLM) and those made by humans through
evaluation from three domain experts in each subject area. This evaluation
aimed to determine whether, in instances of non-matching KCs, evaluators showed
a preference for the LLM-generated KCs over their human-created counterparts.
We also developed an ontology induction algorithm to cluster questions that
assess similar KCs based on their content. Our most effective LLM strategy
accurately matched KCs for 56% of Chemistry and 35% of E-Learning MCQs, with
even higher success when considering the top five KC suggestions. Human
evaluators favored LLM-generated KCs, choosing them over human-assigned ones
approximately two-thirds of the time, a preference that was statistically
significant across both domains. Our clustering algorithm successfully grouped
questions by their underlying KCs without needing explicit labels or contextual

Molecular Modelling of Aqueous Batteries,"Aqueous batteries play an increasingly important role for the development of
sustainable and safety-prioritised energy storage solutions. Compared to
conventional lithium-ion batteries, the cell chemistry in aqueous batteries
share many common features with those of electrolyzer and pseudo-capacitor
systems because of the involvement of aqueous electrolyte and proton activity.
This imposes the needs for a better understanding of the corresponding ion
solvation, intercalation and electron transfer processes at atomistic scale.
Therefore, this chapter provides an up-to-date overview of molecular modelling
techniques and their applications in aqueous batteries. In particular, we
emphasize on the dynamical and reactive description of aqueous battery systems
brought in by density functional theory-based molecular dynamics simulation
(DFTMD) and its machine-learning (ML) accelerated counterpart. Moreover, we
also cover the recent advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in
molecular and materials design of aqueous batteries. Case studies presented
here include popular aqueous battery systems, such as water-in-salt
electrolytes, proton-coupled cathode materials, Zn-ion batteries as well as
organic redox flow batteries.",2024-06-01,2024,2024-06,chemistry
Evaluating the World Model Implicit in a Generative Model,"Recent work suggests that large language models may implicitly learn world
models. How should we assess this possibility? We formalize this question for
the case where the underlying reality is governed by a deterministic finite
automaton. This includes problems as diverse as simple logical reasoning,
geographic navigation, game-playing, and chemistry. We propose new evaluation
metrics for world model recovery inspired by the classic Myhill-Nerode theorem
from language theory. We illustrate their utility in three domains: game
playing, logic puzzles, and navigation. In all domains, the generative models
we consider do well on existing diagnostics for assessing world models, but our
evaluation metrics reveal their world models to be far less coherent than they
appear. Such incoherence creates fragility: using a generative model to solve
related but subtly different tasks can lead to failures. Building generative
models that meaningfully capture the underlying logic of the domains they model
would be immensely valuable; our results suggest new ways to assess how close a
given model is to that goal.",2024-06-06,2024,2024-06,chemistry
FlowMM: Generating Materials with Riemannian Flow Matching,"Crystalline materials are a fundamental component in next-generation
technologies, yet modeling their distribution presents unique computational
challenges. Of the plausible arrangements of atoms in a periodic lattice only a
vanishingly small percentage are thermodynamically stable, which is a key
indicator of the materials that can be experimentally realized. Two fundamental
tasks in this area are to (a) predict the stable crystal structure of a known
composition of elements and (b) propose novel compositions along with their
stable structures. We present FlowMM, a pair of generative models that achieve
state-of-the-art performance on both tasks while being more efficient and more
flexible than competing methods. We generalize Riemannian Flow Matching to suit
the symmetries inherent to crystals: translation, rotation, permutation, and
periodic boundary conditions. Our framework enables the freedom to choose the
flow base distributions, drastically simplifying the problem of learning
crystal structures compared with diffusion models. In addition to standard
benchmarks, we validate FlowMM's generated structures with quantum chemistry
calculations, demonstrating that it is about 3x more efficient, in terms of
integration steps, at finding stable materials compared to previous open
methods.",2024-06-07,2024,2024-06,chemistry
"MolX: Enhancing Large Language Models for Molecular Learning with A
  Multi-Modal Extension","Large Language Models (LLMs) with their strong task-handling capabilities
have shown remarkable advancements across a spectrum of fields, moving beyond
natural language understanding. However, their proficiency within the chemistry
domain remains restricted, especially in solving professional molecule-related
tasks. This challenge is attributed to their inherent limitations in
comprehending molecules using only common textual representations, i.e., SMILES
strings. In this study, we seek to enhance the ability of LLMs to comprehend
molecules by equipping them with a multi-modal external module, namely MolX. In
particular, instead of directly using a SMILES string to represent a molecule,
we utilize specific encoders to extract fine-grained features from both SMILES
string and 2D molecular graph representations for feeding into an LLM.
Moreover, a handcrafted molecular fingerprint is incorporated to leverage its
embedded domain knowledge. Then, to establish an alignment between MolX and the
LLM's textual input space, the whole model in which the LLM is frozen, is
pre-trained with a versatile strategy including a diverse set of tasks.
Experimental evaluations show that our proposed method outperforms baselines
across 4 downstream molecule-related tasks ranging from molecule-to-text
translation to retrosynthesis, with and without fine-tuning the LLM, while only
introducing a small number of trainable parameters 0.53% and 0.82%,
respectively.",2024-06-10,2024,2024-06,chemistry
"SciRIFF: A Resource to Enhance Language Model Instruction-Following over
  Scientific Literature","We present SciRIFF (Scientific Resource for Instruction-Following and
Finetuning), a dataset of 137K instruction-following demonstrations for 54
tasks covering five essential scientific literature understanding capabilities:
information extraction, summarization, question answering, claim verification,
and classification. SciRIFF demonstrations are notable for their long input
contexts, detailed task specifications, and complex structured outputs. While
instruction-following resources are available in specific domains such as
clinical medicine and chemistry, SciRIFF is the first dataset focused on
extracting and synthesizing information from research literature across a wide
range of scientific fields. To demonstrate the utility of SciRIFF, we develop a
sample-efficient strategy to adapt a general instruction-following model for
science by performing additional finetuning on a mix of general-domain and
SciRIFF demonstrations. In evaluations on nine held-out scientific tasks, our
model -- called SciTulu -- improves over a strong LLM baseline by 28.1% and
6.5% at the 7B and 70B scales respectively, while maintaining general
instruction-following performance within 2% of the baseline. We are optimistic
that SciRIFF will facilitate the development and evaluation of LLMs to help
researchers navigate the ever-growing body of scientific literature. We release
our dataset, model checkpoints, and data processing and evaluation code to
enable further research.",2024-06-10,2024,2024-06,chemistry
Are Large Language Models Good Statisticians?,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
a range of scientific tasks including mathematics, physics, and chemistry.
Despite their successes, the effectiveness of LLMs in handling complex
statistical tasks remains systematically under-explored. To bridge this gap, we
introduce StatQA, a new benchmark designed for statistical analysis tasks.
StatQA comprises 11,623 examples tailored to evaluate LLMs' proficiency in
specialized statistical tasks and their applicability assessment capabilities,
particularly for hypothesis testing methods. We systematically experiment with
representative LLMs using various prompting strategies and show that even
state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o achieve a best performance of only
64.83%, indicating significant room for improvement. Notably, while open-source
LLMs (e.g. LLaMA-3) show limited capability, those fine-tuned ones exhibit
marked improvements, outperforming all in-context learning-based methods (e.g.
GPT-4o). Moreover, our comparative human experiments highlight a striking
contrast in error types between LLMs and humans: LLMs primarily make
applicability errors, whereas humans mostly make statistical task confusion
errors. This divergence highlights distinct areas of proficiency and
deficiency, suggesting that combining LLM and human expertise could lead to
complementary strengths, inviting further investigation into their
collaborative potential. Our source code and data are available at

"Deep Learning Domain Adaptation to Understand Physico-Chemical Processes
  from Fluorescence Spectroscopy Small Datasets: Application to Ageing of Olive
  Oil","Fluorescence spectroscopy is a fundamental tool in life sciences and
chemistry, widely used for applications such as environmental monitoring, food
quality control, and biomedical diagnostics. However, analysis of spectroscopic
data with deep learning, in particular of fluorescence excitation-emission
matrices (EEMs), presents significant challenges due to the typically small and
sparse datasets available. Furthermore, the analysis of EEMs is difficult due
to their high dimensionality and overlapping spectral features. This study
proposes a new approach that exploits domain adaptation with pretrained vision
models, alongside a novel interpretability algorithm to address these
challenges. Thanks to specialised feature engineering of the neural networks
described in this work, we are now able to provide deeper insights into the
physico-chemical processes underlying the data. The proposed approach is
demonstrated through the analysis of the oxidation process in extra virgin
olive oil (EVOO) during ageing, showing its effectiveness in predicting quality
indicators and identifying the spectral bands, and thus the molecules involved
in the process. This work describes a significantly innovative approach in the
use of deep learning for spectroscopy, transforming it from a black box into a
tool for understanding complex biological and chemical processes.",2024-06-14,2024,2024-06,chemistry
PRESTO: Progressive Pretraining Enhances Synthetic Chemistry Outcomes,"Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have seen growing adoption across
various scientific disciplines. These advancements encourage the investigation
of molecule-text modeling within synthetic chemistry, a field dedicated to
designing and conducting chemical reactions to synthesize new compounds with
desired properties and applications. Current approaches, however, often neglect
the critical role of multiple molecule graph interaction in understanding
chemical reactions, leading to suboptimal performance in synthetic chemistry
tasks. This study introduces PRESTO(Progressive Pretraining Enhances Synthetic
Chemistry Outcomes), a new framework that bridges the molecule-text modality
gap by integrating a comprehensive benchmark of pretraining strategies and
dataset configurations. It progressively improves multimodal LLMs through
cross-modal alignment and multi-graph understanding. Our extensive experiments

"MR-Ben: A Meta-Reasoning Benchmark for Evaluating System-2 Thinking in
  LLMs","Large language models (LLMs) have shown increasing capability in
problem-solving and decision-making, largely based on the step-by-step
chain-of-thought reasoning processes. However, evaluating these reasoning
abilities has become increasingly challenging. Existing outcome-based
benchmarks are beginning to saturate, becoming less effective in tracking
meaningful progress. To address this, we present a process-based benchmark
MR-Ben that demands a meta-reasoning skill, where LMs are asked to locate and
analyse potential errors in automatically generated reasoning steps. Our
meta-reasoning paradigm is especially suited for system-2 slow thinking,
mirroring the human cognitive process of carefully examining assumptions,
conditions, calculations, and logic to identify mistakes.MR-Ben comprises 5,975
questions curated by human experts across a wide range of subjects, including
physics, chemistry, logic, coding, and more. Through our designed metrics for
assessing meta-reasoning on this benchmark, we identify interesting limitations
and weaknesses of current LLMs (open-source and closed-source models). For
example, with models like the o1 series from OpenAI demonstrating strong
performance by effectively scrutinizing the solution space, many other
state-of-the-art models fall significantly behind on MR-Ben, exposing potential
shortcomings in their training strategies and inference methodologies.",2024-06-20,2024,2024-06,chemistry
"From Text to Test: AI-Generated Control Software for Materials Science
  Instruments","Large language models (LLMs) are transforming the landscape of chemistry and
materials science. Recent examples of LLM-accelerated experimental research
include virtual assistants for parsing synthesis recipes from the literature,
or using the extracted knowledge to guide synthesis and characterization.
Despite these advancements, their application is constrained to labs with
automated instruments and control software, leaving much of materials science
reliant on manual processes. Here, we demonstrate the rapid deployment of a
Python-based control module for a Keithley 2400 electrical source measure unit
using ChatGPT-4. Through iterative refinement, we achieved effective instrument
management with minimal human intervention. Additionally, a user-friendly
graphical user interface (GUI) was created, effectively linking all instrument
controls to interactive screen elements. Finally, we integrated this AI-crafted
instrument control software with a high-performance stochastic optimization
algorithm to facilitate rapid and automated extraction of electronic device
parameters related to semiconductor charge transport mechanisms from
current-voltage (IV) measurement data. This integration resulted in a
comprehensive open-source toolkit for semiconductor device characterization and
analysis using IV curve measurements. We demonstrate the application of these
tools by acquiring, analyzing, and parameterizing IV data from a
Pt/Cr$_2$O$_3$:Mg/$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ heterojunction diode, a novel stack for
high-power and high-temperature electronic devices. This approach underscores
the powerful synergy between LLMs and the development of instruments for
scientific inquiry, showcasing a path for further acceleration in materials
science.",2024-06-23,2024,2024-06,chemistry
"Efficient Evolutionary Search Over Chemical Space with Large Language
  Models","Molecular discovery, when formulated as an optimization problem, presents
significant computational challenges because optimization objectives can be
non-differentiable. Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), often used to optimize
black-box objectives in molecular discovery, traverse chemical space by
performing random mutations and crossovers, leading to a large number of
expensive objective evaluations. In this work, we ameliorate this shortcoming
by incorporating chemistry-aware Large Language Models (LLMs) into EAs. Namely,
we redesign crossover and mutation operations in EAs using LLMs trained on
large corpora of chemical information. We perform extensive empirical studies
on both commercial and open-source models on multiple tasks involving property
optimization, molecular rediscovery, and structure-based drug design,
demonstrating that the joint usage of LLMs with EAs yields superior performance
over all baseline models across single- and multi-objective settings. We
demonstrate that our algorithm improves both the quality of the final solution
and convergence speed, thereby reducing the number of required objective
evaluations. Our code is available at http://github.com/zoom-wang112358/MOLLEO",2024-06-23,2024,2024-06,chemistry
OlympicArena Medal Ranks: Who Is the Most Intelligent AI So Far?,"In this report, we pose the following question: Who is the most intelligent
AI model to date, as measured by the OlympicArena (an Olympic-level,
multi-discipline, multi-modal benchmark for superintelligent AI)? We
specifically focus on the most recently released models: Claude-3.5-Sonnet,
Gemini-1.5-Pro, and GPT-4o. For the first time, we propose using an Olympic
medal Table approach to rank AI models based on their comprehensive performance
across various disciplines. Empirical results reveal: (1) Claude-3.5-Sonnet
shows highly competitive overall performance over GPT-4o, even surpassing
GPT-4o on a few subjects (i.e., Physics, Chemistry, and Biology). (2)
Gemini-1.5-Pro and GPT-4V are ranked consecutively just behind GPT-4o and
Claude-3.5-Sonnet, but with a clear performance gap between them. (3) The
performance of AI models from the open-source community significantly lags
behind these proprietary models. (4) The performance of these models on this
benchmark has been less than satisfactory, indicating that we still have a long

KANQAS: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for Quantum Architecture Search,"Quantum architecture Search (QAS) is a promising direction for optimization
and automated design of quantum circuits towards quantum advantage. Recent
techniques in QAS emphasize Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)-based deep Q-networks.
However, their interpretability remains challenging due to the large number of
learnable parameters and the complexities involved in selecting appropriate
activation functions. In this work, to overcome these challenges, we utilize
the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) in the QAS algorithm, analyzing their
efficiency in the task of quantum state preparation and quantum chemistry. In
quantum state preparation, our results show that in a noiseless scenario, the
probability of success is 2 to 5 times higher than MLPs. In noisy environments,
KAN outperforms MLPs in fidelity when approximating these states, showcasing
its robustness against noise. In tackling quantum chemistry problems, we
enhance the recently proposed QAS algorithm by integrating curriculum
reinforcement learning with a KAN structure. This facilitates a more efficient
design of parameterized quantum circuits by reducing the number of required
2-qubit gates and circuit depth. Further investigation reveals that KAN
requires a significantly smaller number of learnable parameters compared to
MLPs; however, the average time of executing each episode for KAN is higher.",2024-06-25,2024,2024-06,chemistry
A Review of Large Language Models and Autonomous Agents in Chemistry,"Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools in chemistry,

autonomous agents, addressing specific challenges, opportunities, and future
directions in chemistry. Key challenges include data quality and integration,

application of LLMs in specialized domains like biopharmaceuticals and

intricate terminologies, specialized knowledge, and a high demand for precision
areas where general purpose LLMs often fall short. In this study, we introduce
PharmaGPT, a suite of domain specilized LLMs with 13 billion and 70 billion
parameters, specifically trained on a comprehensive corpus tailored to the
Bio-Pharmaceutical and Chemical domains. Our evaluation shows that PharmaGPT
surpasses existing general models on specific-domain benchmarks such as NAPLEX,
demonstrating its exceptional capability in domain-specific tasks. Remarkably,
this performance is achieved with a model that has only a fraction, sometimes
just one-tenth-of the parameters of general-purpose large models. This
advancement establishes a new benchmark for LLMs in the bio-pharmaceutical and

Machine learning meets mass spectrometry: a focused perspective,"Mass spectrometry is a widely used method to study molecules and processes in
medicine, life sciences, chemistry, catalysis, and industrial product quality
control, among many other applications. One of the main features of some mass
spectrometry techniques is the extensive level of characterization (especially
when coupled with chromatography and ion mobility methods, or a part of tandem
mass spectrometry experiment) and a large amount of generated data per
measurement. Terabyte scales can be easily reached with mass spectrometry
studies. Consequently, mass spectrometry has faced the challenge of a high
level of data disappearance. Researchers often neglect and then altogether lose
access to the rich information mass spectrometry experiments could provide.
With the development of machine learning methods, the opportunity arises to
unlock the potential of these data, enabling previously inaccessible
discoveries. The present perspective highlights reevaluation of mass
spectrometry data analysis in the new generation of methods and describes
significant challenges in the field, particularly related to problems involving
the use of electrospray ionization. We argue that further applications of
machine learning raise new requirements for instrumentation (increasing
throughput and information density, decreasing pricing, and making more
automation-friendly software), and once met, the field may experience
significant transformation.",2024-06-27,2024,2024-06,chemistry
On the Expressive Power of Sparse Geometric MPNNs,"Motivated by applications in chemistry and other sciences, we study the
expressive power of message-passing neural networks for geometric graphs, whose
node features correspond to 3-dimensional positions. Recent work has shown that
such models can separate generic pairs of non-isomorphic geometric graphs,
though they may fail to separate some rare and complicated instances. However,
these results assume a fully connected graph, where each node possesses
complete knowledge of all other nodes. In contrast, often, in application,
every node only possesses knowledge of a small number of nearest neighbors.
  This paper shows that generic pairs of non-isomorphic geometric graphs can be
separated by message-passing networks with rotation equivariant features as
long as the underlying graph is connected. When only invariant intermediate
features are allowed, generic separation is guaranteed for generically globally
rigid graphs. We introduce a simple architecture, EGENNET, which achieves our
theoretical guarantees and compares favorably with alternative architecture on

"Unraveling Molecular Structure: A Multimodal Spectroscopic Dataset for
  Chemistry","Spectroscopic techniques are essential tools for determining the structure of
molecules. Different spectroscopic techniques, such as Nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR), Infrared spectroscopy, and Mass Spectrometry, provide insight
into the molecular structure, including the presence or absence of functional
groups. Chemists leverage the complementary nature of the different methods to
their advantage. However, the lack of a comprehensive multimodal dataset,
containing spectra from a variety of spectroscopic techniques, has limited
machine-learning approaches mostly to single-modality tasks for predicting
molecular structures from spectra. Here we introduce a dataset comprising
simulated $^1$H-NMR, $^{13}$C-NMR, HSQC-NMR, Infrared, and Mass spectra
(positive and negative ion modes) for 790k molecules extracted from chemical

"Show, Don't Tell: Evaluating Large Language Models Beyond Textual
  Understanding with ChildPlay","We developed a benchmark set to assess the generalization of state-of-the-art
large language models on problems beyond linguistic tasks and evaluate it on a
systematic progression of GPT models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini).
Using simple games like Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four, Battleship, and a Shape
Recognition Game, all encoded in ASCII, we test strategic capabilities and
spatial reasoning, core abilities any artificial intelligence would need to
master for solving problems in chemistry. To probe generalization, we introduce
two new games for spatial logic: LEGO Connect Language (LCL) and
Guess-the-SMILES (GtS), a operationally simple chemistry benchmark. Our results
show that GPT models provide meaningful responses for several tasks but,
generally, perform poorly. A systematic performance progression with increased
model capabilities (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o) is only observed for 4 out of the 7
benchmark tasks. All models consistently struggle with Battleship, LCL, and
GtS. This suggests that while GPT models can emulate conversational proficiency
and basic rule comprehension, they have limited generalization with respect to

that learns a unified reaction representation from SMILES, reaction graphs, and
textual corpus for chemical reaction recommendation (RCR). To train MM-RCR, we
construct 1.2 million pair-wised Q\&A instruction datasets. Our experimental

as implemented in the MLChem4D and QMLMaterials codes. The proposed QAL uses
quantum support vector regressor (QSVR) or a quantum Gaussian process regressor

(PINN) able to solve the Schr\""odinger equation for a given potential, by
finding its eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. This technique is unsupervised, and
utilizes a novel computational method in a manner that is barely explored.
PINNs are a deep learning method that exploits Automatic Differentiation to
solve Integro-Differential Equations in a mesh-free way. We show how to find
both the ground and the excited states. The method discovers the states
progressively by starting from the ground state. We explain how to introduce
inductive biases in the loss to exploit further knowledge of the physical
system. Such additional constraints allow for a faster and more accurate
convergence. This technique can then be enhanced by a smart choice of
collocation points in order to take advantage of the mesh-free nature of the
PINN. The methods are made explicit by applying them to the infinite potential
well and the particle in a ring, a challenging problem to be learned by an
Artificial Intelligence agent due to the presence of complex-valued
eigenfunctions and degenerate states.",2024-07-30,2024,2024-07,chemistry
"CEAR: Automatic construction of a knowledge graph of chemical entities
  and roles from scientific literature","Ontologies are formal representations of knowledge in specific domains that
provide a structured framework for organizing and understanding complex
information. Creating ontologies, however, is a complex and time-consuming
endeavor. ChEBI is a well-known ontology in the field of chemistry, which
provides a comprehensive resource for defining chemical entities and their
properties. However, it covers only a small fraction of the rapidly growing
knowledge in chemistry and does not provide references to the scientific
literature. To address this, we propose a methodology that involves augmenting
existing annotated text corpora with knowledge from Chebi and fine-tuning a
large language model (LLM) to recognize chemical entities and their roles in
scientific text. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
By combining ontological knowledge and the language understanding capabilities
of LLMs, we achieve high precision and recall rates in identifying both the
chemical entities and roles in scientific literature. Furthermore, we extract
them from a set of 8,000 ChemRxiv articles, and apply a second LLM to create a
knowledge graph (KG) of chemical entities and roles (CEAR), which provides
complementary information to ChEBI, and can help to extend it.",2024-07-31,2024,2024-07,chemistry

components with (1) high sensitivity, (2) power efficiency, (3)
miniaturizability and (4) the ability to directly interface with electronic

several nanoparticle-based approaches have found their way into this field and
have demonstrated high performance. However, challenges remain, such as the
toxicity of many of today's narrow bandgap semiconductors for NIR detection and
the high energy consumption as well as low selectivity of state-of-the-art
commercialized gas sensors. With their unique light-matter interaction and
ink-based fabrication schemes, plasmonic nanostructures provide potential
technological solutions to these challenges, leading also to better
environmental performance. In this perspective we discuss recent approaches of
using plasmonic nanoparticles for the fabrication of NIR photodetectors and
light-activated, energy-efficient gas sensing devices. In addition, we point
out new strategies implying computational approaches for miniaturizable
spectrometers, exploiting the wide spectral tunability of plasmonic
nanocomposites, and for selective gas sensors, utilizing dynamic light

  Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with GANs for Unpaired I2I Translation","Image-to-Image translation in Generative Artificial Intelligence (Generative
AI) has been a central focus of research, with applications spanning
healthcare, remote sensing, physics, chemistry, photography, and more. Among
the numerous methodologies, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with

Our novel approach replaces the two-layer MLP with a two-layer KAN in the
existing Contrastive Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation (CUT) model,
developing the KAN-CUT model. This substitution favors the generation of more
informative features in low-dimensional vector representations, which
contrastive learning can utilize more effectively to produce high-quality

has remained unexplored. Herein, we demonstrate that large, pre-trained
chemistry foundation models can serve as a basis for enabling
structure-focused, semantic chemistry information retrieval for both
small-molecules, complex polymeric materials, and reactions. Additionally, we
show the use of chemistry foundation models in conjunction with multi-modal

The scaling challenges we discuss include developing steering strategies that
maximize node utilization, introducing data fabrics that reduce communication
overhead of data-intensive tasks, and implementing workflow tasks that cache
costly operations between invocations. These innovations coupled with a variety
of application patterns accessible through our agent-based steering model have

transparency and trust in AI systems, where traditional XAI approaches
typically offer one level of abstraction for explanations, often in the form of
heatmaps highlighting single or multiple input features. However, we ask
whether abstract reasoning or problem-solving strategies of a model may also be
relevant, as these align more closely with how humans approach solutions to

relevance to symbolic queries expressing logical relationships between input
features, thereby capturing the abstract reasoning behind a model's
predictions. The methodology is built upon a simple yet general multi-order
decomposition of model predictions. This decomposition can be specified using
higher-order propagation-based relevance methods, such as GNN-LRP, or
perturbation-based explanation methods commonly used in XAI. The effectiveness
of our framework is demonstrated in the domains of natural language processing

Machine Learning and Theory Ladenness -- A Phenomenological Account,"In recent years, the dissemination of machine learning (ML) methodologies in
scientific research has prompted discussions on theory ladenness. More
specifically, the issue of theory ladenness has remerged as questions about
whether and how ML models (MLMs) and ML modelling strategies are impacted by
the domain theory of the scientific field in which ML is used and implemented
(e.g., physics, chemistry, biology, etc). On the one hand, some have argued
that there is no difference between traditional (pre ML) and ML assisted
science. In both cases, theory plays an essential and unavoidable role in the
analysis of phenomena and the construction and use of models. Others have
argued instead that ML methodologies and models are theory independent and, in
some cases, even theory free. In this article, we argue that both positions are
overly simplistic and do not advance our understanding of the interplay between
ML methods and domain theories. Specifically, we provide an analysis of theory
ladenness in ML assisted science. Our analysis reveals that, while the
construction of MLMs can be relatively independent of domain theory, the

wide range of chemical domain tasks. Specifically, ChemEval identified 4
crucial progressive levels in chemistry, assessing 12 dimensions of LLMs across
42 distinct chemical tasks which are informed by open-source data and the data
meticulously crafted by chemical experts, ensuring that the tasks have
practical value and can effectively evaluate the capabilities of LLMs. In the

of computational chemistry. Recently, Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) and
Score-Based Generative Models (SGMs) are effectively used due to their capacity
for generating accurate conformations far beyond conventional physics-based
approaches. However, the discrepancy between training and inference rises a
critical problem known as the exposure bias. While this issue has been
extensively investigated in DPMs, the existence of exposure bias in SGMs and
its effective measurement remain unsolved, which hinders the use of
compensation methods for SGMs, including ConfGF and Torsional Diffusion as the

PepINVENT: Generative peptide design beyond the natural amino acids,"Peptides play a crucial role in the drug design and discovery whether as a
therapeutic modality or a delivery agent. Non-natural amino acids (NNAAs) have
been used to enhance the peptide properties from binding affinity, plasma

more effective peptides with improved properties. The generative models used in
the field, have focused on navigating the peptide sequence space. The sequence
space is formed by combinations of a predefined set of amino acids. However,
there is still a need for a tool to explore the peptide landscape beyond this
enumerated space to unlock and effectively incorporate de novo design of new
amino acids. To thoroughly explore the theoretical chemical space of the
peptides, we present PepINVENT, a novel generative AI-based tool as an
extension to the small molecule molecular design platform, REINVENT. PepINVENT
navigates the vast space of natural and non-natural amino acids to propose
valid, novel, and diverse peptide designs. The generative model can serve as a
central tool for peptide-related tasks, as it was not trained on peptides with
specific properties or topologies. The prior was trained to understand the
granularity of peptides and to design amino acids for filling the masked
positions within a peptide. PepINVENT coupled with reinforcement learning
enables the goal-oriented design of peptides using its chemistry-informed
generative capabilities. This study demonstrates PepINVENT's ability to explore

Susceptibility Formulation of Density Matrix Perturbation Theory,"Density matrix perturbation theory based on recursive Fermi-operator
expansions provides a computationally efficient framework for time-independent
response calculations in quantum chemistry and materials science. From a
perturbation in the Hamiltonian we can calculate the first-order perturbation
in the density matrix, which then gives us the linear response in the
expectation values for some chosen set of observables. Here we present an
alternative, {\it dual} formulation, where we instead calculate the static
susceptibility of an observable, which then gives us the linear response in the
expectation values for any number of different Hamiltonian perturbations. We
show how the calculation of the susceptibility can be performed with the same
expansion schemes used in recursive density matrix perturbation theory,
including generalizations to fractional occupation numbers and self-consistent
linear response calculations, i.e. similar to density functional perturbation
theory. As with recursive density matrix perturbation theory, the dual
susceptibility formulation is well suited for numerically thresholded sparse
matrix algebra, which has linear scaling complexity for sufficiently large
sparse systems. Similarly, the recursive computation of the susceptibility also
seamlessly integrates with the computational framework of deep neural networks
used in artificial intelligence (AI) applications. This integration enables the
calculation of quantum response properties that can leverage cutting-edge

generative modeling. Recently proposed diffusion bridge models provide a
potential solution, but they rely on a joint distribution that is difficult to
obtain in practice. Furthermore, formulations based on continuous domains limit
their applicability to discrete domains such as graphs. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Discrete Diffusion Schr\""odinger Bridge Matching
(DDSBM), a novel framework that utilizes continuous-time Markov chains to solve
the SB problem in a high-dimensional discrete state space. Our approach extends
Iterative Markovian Fitting to discrete domains, and we have proved its
convergence to the SB. Furthermore, we adapt our framework for the graph
transformation, and show that our design choice of underlying dynamics
characterized by independent modifications of nodes and edges can be
interpreted as the entropy-regularized version of optimal transport with a cost
function described by the graph edit distance. To demonstrate the effectiveness
of our framework, we have applied DDSBM to molecular optimization in the field
of chemistry. Experimental results demonstrate that DDSBM effectively optimizes

"SciSafeEval: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Safety Alignment of Large
  Language Models in Scientific Tasks","Large language models (LLMs) have a transformative impact on a variety of
scientific tasks across disciplines including biology, chemistry, medicine, and
physics. However, ensuring the safety alignment of these models in scientific
research remains an underexplored area, with existing benchmarks primarily
focusing on textual content and overlooking key scientific representations such
as molecular, protein, and genomic languages. Moreover, the safety mechanisms
of LLMs in scientific tasks are insufficiently studied. To address these
limitations, we introduce SciSafeEval, a comprehensive benchmark designed to
evaluate the safety alignment of LLMs across a range of scientific tasks.
SciSafeEval spans multiple scientific languages-including textual, molecular,
protein, and genomic-and covers a wide range of scientific domains. We evaluate
LLMs in zero-shot, few-shot and chain-of-thought settings, and introduce a
""jailbreak"" enhancement feature that challenges LLMs equipped with safety
guardrails, rigorously testing their defenses against malicious intention. Our
benchmark surpasses existing safety datasets in both scale and scope, providing
a robust platform for assessing the safety and performance of LLMs in
scientific contexts. This work aims to facilitate the responsible development
and deployment of LLMs, promoting alignment with safety and ethical standards
in scientific research.",2024-10-02,2024,2024-10,chemistry
"SymmetricDiffusers: Learning Discrete Diffusion on Finite Symmetric
  Groups","Finite symmetric groups $S_n$ are essential in fields such as combinatorics,
physics, and chemistry. However, learning a probability distribution over $S_n$
poses significant challenges due to its intractable size and discrete nature.
In this paper, we introduce SymmetricDiffusers, a novel discrete diffusion
model that simplifies the task of learning a complicated distribution over
$S_n$ by decomposing it into learning simpler transitions of the reverse
diffusion using deep neural networks. We identify the riffle shuffle as an
effective forward transition and provide empirical guidelines for selecting the
diffusion length based on the theory of random walks on finite groups.
Additionally, we propose a generalized Plackett-Luce (PL) distribution for the
reverse transition, which is provably more expressive than the PL distribution.
We further introduce a theoretically grounded ""denoising schedule"" to improve
sampling and learning efficiency. Extensive experiments show that our model
achieves state-of-the-art or comparable performances on solving tasks including
sorting 4-digit MNIST images, jigsaw puzzles, and traveling salesman problems.

Text-guided Diffusion Model for 3D Molecule Generation,"The de novo generation of molecules with targeted properties is crucial in
biology, chemistry, and drug discovery. Current generative models are limited
to using single property values as conditions, struggling with complex
customizations described in detailed human language. To address this, we
propose the text guidance instead, and introduce TextSMOG, a new Text-guided
Small Molecule Generation Approach via 3D Diffusion Model which integrates
language and diffusion models for text-guided small molecule generation. This
method uses textual conditions to guide molecule generation, enhancing both
stability and diversity. Experimental results show TextSMOG's proficiency in
capturing and utilizing information from textual descriptions, making it a
powerful tool for generating 3D molecular structures in response to complex
textual customizations.",2024-10-04,2024,2024-10,chemistry
"REBIND: Enhancing ground-state molecular conformation via force-based
  graph rewiring","Predicting the ground-state 3D molecular conformations from 2D molecular
graphs is critical in computational chemistry due to its profound impact on
molecular properties. Deep learning (DL) approaches have recently emerged as
promising alternatives to computationally-heavy classical methods such as
density functional theory (DFT). However, we discover that existing DL methods
inadequately model inter-atomic forces, particularly for non-bonded atomic
pairs, due to their naive usage of bonds and pairwise distances. Consequently,
significant prediction errors occur for atoms with low degree (i.e., low
coordination numbers) whose conformations are primarily influenced by
non-bonded interactions. To address this, we propose REBIND, a novel framework
that rewires molecular graphs by adding edges based on the Lennard-Jones
potential to capture non-bonded interactions for low-degree atoms. Experimental
results demonstrate that REBIND significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
methods across various molecular sizes, achieving up to a 20\% reduction in
prediction error.",2024-10-04,2024,2024-10,chemistry
"How Do Large Language Models Understand Graph Patterns? A Benchmark for
  Graph Pattern Comprehension","Benchmarking the capabilities and limitations of large language models (LLMs)
in graph-related tasks is becoming an increasingly popular and crucial area of
research. Recent studies have shown that LLMs exhibit a preliminary ability to
understand graph structures and node features. However, the potential of LLMs
in graph pattern mining remains largely unexplored. This is a key component in
fields such as computational chemistry, biology, and social network analysis.
To bridge this gap, this work introduces a comprehensive benchmark to assess
LLMs' capabilities in graph pattern tasks. We have developed a benchmark that
evaluates whether LLMs can understand graph patterns based on either
terminological or topological descriptions. Additionally, our benchmark tests
the LLMs' capacity to autonomously discover graph patterns from data. The
benchmark encompasses both synthetic and real datasets, and a variety of
models, with a total of 11 tasks and 7 models. Our experimental framework is
designed for easy expansion to accommodate new models and datasets. Our
findings reveal that: (1) LLMs have preliminary abilities to understand graph
patterns, with O1-mini outperforming in the majority of tasks; (2) Formatting
input data to align with the knowledge acquired during pretraining can enhance
performance; (3) The strategies employed by LLMs may differ from those used in
conventional algorithms.",2024-10-04,2024,2024-10,chemistry
"Validation of the Scientific Literature via Chemputation Augmented by
  Large Language Models","Chemputation is the process of programming chemical robots to do experiments
using a universal symbolic language, but the literature can be error prone and
hard to read due to ambiguities. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in various domains, including natural language
processing, robotic control, and more recently, chemistry. Despite significant
advancements in standardizing the reporting and collection of synthetic
chemistry data, the automatic reproduction of reported syntheses remains a
labour-intensive task. In this work, we introduce an LLM-based chemical
research agent workflow designed for the automatic validation of synthetic
literature procedures. Our workflow can autonomously extract synthetic
procedures and analytical data from extensive documents, translate these
procedures into universal XDL code, simulate the execution of the procedure in
a hardware-specific setup, and ultimately execute the procedure on an
XDL-controlled robotic system for synthetic chemistry. This demonstrates the
potential of LLM-based workflows for autonomous chemical synthesis with
Chemputers. Due to the abstraction of XDL this approach is safe, secure, and
scalable since hallucinations will not be chemputable and the XDL can be both
verified and encrypted. Unlike previous efforts, which either addressed only a
limited portion of the workflow, relied on inflexible hard-coded rules, or
lacked validation in physical systems, our approach provides four realistic
examples of syntheses directly executed from synthetic literature. We
anticipate that our workflow will significantly enhance automation in
robotically driven synthetic chemistry research, streamline data extraction,
improve the reproducibility, scalability, and safety of synthetic and
experimental chemistry.",2024-10-08,2024,2024-10,chemistry
Chain-of-Thoughts for Molecular Understanding,"The adaptation of large language models (LLMs) to chemistry has shown
promising performance in molecular understanding tasks, such as generating a
text description from a molecule. However, proper reasoning based on molecular
structural information remains a significant challenge, e.g., even advanced
LLMs such as GPT-4o struggle to identify functional groups which are crucial
for inferring the molecular property of interest. To address this limitation,
we propose StructCoT, a structure-aware chain-of-thought (CoT) that enhances
LLMs' understanding of molecular structures by explicitly injecting the key
structural features of molecules. Moreover, we introduce two fine-tuning
frameworks for adapting the existing LLMs to use our StructCoT. Our experiments
demonstrate that incorporating StructCoT with our fine-tuning frameworks leads
to consistent improvements in both molecular understanding tasks.",2024-10-08,2024,2024-10,chemistry
"MOOSE-Chem: Large Language Models for Rediscovering Unseen Chemistry
  Scientific Hypotheses","Scientific discovery contributes largely to human society's prosperity, and
recent progress shows that LLMs could potentially catalyze this process.
However, it is still unclear whether LLMs can discover novel and valid
hypotheses in chemistry. In this work, we investigate this central research
question: Can LLMs automatically discover novel and valid chemistry research
hypotheses given only a chemistry research background (consisting of a research
question and/or a background survey), without limitation on the domain of the
research question? After extensive discussions with chemistry experts, we
propose an assumption that a majority of chemistry hypotheses can be resulted
from a research background and several inspirations. With this key insight, we
break the central question into three smaller fundamental questions. In brief,
they are: (1) given a background question, whether LLMs can retrieve good
inspirations; (2) with background and inspirations, whether LLMs can lead to
hypothesis; and (3) whether LLMs can identify good hypotheses to rank them
higher. To investigate these questions, we construct a benchmark consisting of
51 chemistry papers published in Nature, Science, or a similar level in 2024
(all papers are only available online since 2024). Every paper is divided by
chemistry PhD students into three components: background, inspirations, and
hypothesis. The goal is to rediscover the hypothesis, given only the background
and a large randomly selected chemistry literature corpus consisting the ground
truth inspiration papers, with LLMs trained with data up to 2023. We also
develop an LLM-based multi-agent framework that leverages the assumption,
consisting of three stages reflecting the three smaller questions. The proposed
method can rediscover many hypotheses with very high similarity with the ground
truth ones, covering the main innovations.",2024-10-09,2024,2024-10,chemistry
Chemistry-Inspired Diffusion with Non-Differentiable Guidance,"Recent advances in diffusion models have shown remarkable potential in the
conditional generation of novel molecules. These models can be guided in two
ways: (i) explicitly, through additional features representing the condition,
or (ii) implicitly, using a property predictor. However, training property
predictors or conditional diffusion models requires an abundance of labeled
data and is inherently challenging in real-world applications. We propose a
novel approach that attenuates the limitations of acquiring large labeled
datasets by leveraging domain knowledge from quantum chemistry as a
non-differentiable oracle to guide an unconditional diffusion model. Instead of
relying on neural networks, the oracle provides accurate guidance in the form
of estimated gradients, allowing the diffusion process to sample from a
conditional distribution specified by quantum chemistry. We show that this
results in more precise conditional generation of novel and stable molecular
structures. Our experiments demonstrate that our method: (1) significantly
reduces atomic forces, enhancing the validity of generated molecules when used
for stability optimization; (2) is compatible with both explicit and implicit
guidance in diffusion models, enabling joint optimization of molecular
properties and stability; and (3) generalizes effectively to molecular
optimization tasks beyond stability optimization.",2024-10-09,2024,2024-10,chemistry
"DLGNet: Hyperedge Classification through Directed Line Graphs for
  Chemical Reactions","Graphs and hypergraphs provide powerful abstractions for modeling
interactions among a set of entities of interest and have been attracting a
growing interest in the literature thanks to many successful applications in
several fields. In particular, they are rapidly expanding in domains such as
chemistry and biology, especially in the areas of drug discovery and molecule
generation. One of the areas witnessing the fasted growth is the chemical
reactions field, where chemical reactions can be naturally encoded as directed
hyperedges of a hypergraph. In this paper, we address the chemical reaction
classification problem by introducing the notation of a Directed Line Graph
(DGL) associated with a given directed hypergraph. On top of it, we build the
Directed Line Graph Network (DLGNet), the first spectral-based Graph Neural
Network (GNN) expressly designed to operate on a hypergraph via its DLG
transformation. The foundation of DLGNet is a novel Hermitian matrix, the
Directed Line Graph Laplacian, which compactly encodes the directionality of
the interactions taking place within the directed hyperedges of the hypergraph
thanks to the DLG representation. The Directed Line Graph Laplacian enjoys many
desirable properties, including admitting an eigenvalue decomposition and being
positive semidefinite, which make it well-suited for its adoption within a
spectral-based GNN. Through extensive experiments on chemical reaction
datasets, we show that DGLNet significantly outperforms the existing
approaches, achieving on a collection of real-world datasets an average
relative-percentage-difference improvement of 33.01%, with a maximum
improvement of 37.71%.",2024-10-09,2024,2024-10,chemistry
"PEAR: A Robust and Flexible Automation Framework for Ptychography
  Enabled by Multiple Large Language Model Agents","Ptychography is an advanced computational imaging technique in X-ray and
electron microscopy. It has been widely adopted across scientific research
fields, including physics, chemistry, biology, and materials science, as well
as in industrial applications such as semiconductor characterization. In
practice, obtaining high-quality ptychographic images requires simultaneous
optimization of numerous experimental and algorithmic parameters.
Traditionally, parameter selection often relies on trial and error, leading to
low-throughput workflows and potential human bias. In this work, we develop the
""Ptychographic Experiment and Analysis Robot"" (PEAR), a framework that
leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate data analysis in
ptychography. To ensure high robustness and accuracy, PEAR employs multiple LLM
agents for tasks including knowledge retrieval, code generation, parameter
recommendation, and image reasoning. Our study demonstrates that PEAR's
multi-agent design significantly improves the workflow success rate, even with
smaller open-weight models such as LLaMA 3.1 8B. PEAR also supports various

Analyzing Atomic Interactions in Molecules as Learned by Neural Networks,"While machine learning (ML) models have been able to achieve unprecedented
accuracies across various prediction tasks in quantum chemistry, it is now
apparent that accuracy on a test set alone is not a guarantee for robust
chemical modeling such as stable molecular dynamics (MD). To go beyond
accuracy, we use explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques to
develop a general analysis framework for atomic interactions and apply it to
the SchNet and PaiNN neural network models. We compare these interactions with
a set of fundamental chemical principles to understand how well the models have
learned the underlying physicochemical concepts from the data. We focus on the
strength of the interactions for different atomic species, how predictions for
intensive and extensive quantum molecular properties are made, and analyze the
decay and many-body nature of the interactions with interatomic distance.
Models that deviate too far from known physical principles produce unstable MD
trajectories, even when they have very high energy and force prediction
accuracy. We also suggest further improvements to the ML architectures to
better account for the polynomial decay of atomic interactions.",2024-10-17,2024,2024-10,chemistry
"Dynamic Guided and Domain Applicable Safeguards for Enhanced Security in
  Large Language Models","With the extensive deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs), ensuring their
safety has become increasingly critical. However, existing defense methods
often struggle with two key issues: (i) inadequate defense capabilities,
particularly in domain-specific scenarios like chemistry, where a lack of
specialized knowledge can lead to the generation of harmful responses to
malicious queries. (ii) over-defensiveness, which compromises the general
utility and responsiveness of LLMs. To mitigate these issues, we introduce a
multi-agents-based defense framework, Guide for Defense (G4D), which leverages
accurate external information to provide an unbiased summary of user intentions
and analytically grounded safety response guidance. Extensive experiments on
popular jailbreak attacks and benign datasets show that our G4D can enhance
LLM's robustness against jailbreak attacks on general and domain-specific
scenarios without compromising the model's general functionality.",2024-10-23,2024,2024-10,chemistry

integrating narrative structures into prompting techniques for problem-solving.
This approach involves constructing narratives around problem statements and
creating a framework to identify and organize relevant information. Our
experiments show that using various LLMs with SoT consistently surpasses using
them with other techniques on physics, chemistry, math, and biology questions
in both the GPQA and JEEBench datasets. The narrative-based information

A Foundation Model for Chemical Design and Property Prediction,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly advanced computational
chemistry research in various tasks. However, traditional AI methods often rely
on task-specific model designs and training, which constrain both the
scalability of model size and generalization across different tasks. Here, we
introduce ChemFM, a large foundation model specifically developed for
chemicals. ChemFM comprises 3 billion parameters and is pre-trained on 178
million molecules using self-supervised causal language modeling to extract
generalizable molecular representations. This model can be adapted to diverse
downstream chemical applications using either full-parameter or
parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. ChemFM consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art task-specific AI models across all tested tasks. Notably, it
achieves up to 67.48% performance improvement across 34 property prediction
benchmarks, up to 33.80% reduction in mean average deviation between
conditioned and actual properties of generated molecules in conditional
molecular generation tasks, and up to 3.7% top-1 accuracy improvement across 4
reaction prediction datasets. Moreover, ChemFM demonstrates its superior
performance in predicting antibiotic activity and cytotoxicity, highlighting
its potential to advance the discovery of novel antibiotics. We anticipate that
ChemFM will significantly advance chemistry research by providing a foundation

Bridging Geometric States via Geometric Diffusion Bridge,"The accurate prediction of geometric state evolution in complex systems is
critical for advancing scientific domains such as quantum chemistry and
material modeling. Traditional experimental and computational methods face
challenges in terms of environmental constraints and computational demands,
while current deep learning approaches still fall short in terms of precision
and generality. In this work, we introduce the Geometric Diffusion Bridge
(GDB), a novel generative modeling framework that accurately bridges initial
and target geometric states. GDB leverages a probabilistic approach to evolve
geometric state distributions, employing an equivariant diffusion bridge
derived by a modified version of Doob's $h$-transform for connecting geometric
states. This tailored diffusion process is anchored by initial and target
geometric states as fixed endpoints and governed by equivariant transition
kernels. Moreover, trajectory data can be seamlessly leveraged in our GDB
framework by using a chain of equivariant diffusion bridges, providing a more
detailed and accurate characterization of evolution dynamics. Theoretically, we
conduct a thorough examination to confirm our framework's ability to preserve
joint distributions of geometric states and capability to completely model the
underlying dynamics inducing trajectory distributions with negligible error.
Experimental evaluations across various real-world scenarios show that GDB
surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches, opening up a new pathway for
accurately bridging geometric states and tackling crucial scientific challenges

"Pre-trained Molecular Language Models with Random Functional Group
  Masking","Recent advancements in computational chemistry have leveraged the power of
trans-former-based language models, such as MoLFormer, pre-trained using a vast
amount of simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) sequences, to
understand and predict molecular properties and activities, a critical step in
fields like drug discovery and materials science. To further improve
performance, researchers have introduced graph neural networks with graph-based
molecular representations, such as GEM, incorporating the topology, geometry,
2D or even 3D structures of molecules into pre-training. While most of
molecular graphs in existing studies were automatically converted from SMILES
sequences, it is to assume that transformer-based language models might be able
to implicitly learn structure-aware representations from SMILES sequences. In

molecular structures and properties, thus enhancing its predictive
capabilities. Extensive experimental evaluations across 11 benchmark
classification and regression tasks in the chemical domain demonstrate the

Transformer architectures. While Transformers have yielded impressive results,
their quadratic runtime dependency on the sequence length complicates their use
for long genomic sequences and in-context learning on proteins and chemical
sequences. Recently, the recurrent xLSTM architecture has been shown to perform
favorably compared to Transformers and modern state-space model (SSM)
architectures in the natural language domain. Similar to SSMs, xLSTMs have a
linear runtime dependency on the sequence length and allow for constant-memory
decoding at inference time, which makes them prime candidates for modeling
long-range dependencies in biological and chemical sequences. In this work, we
tailor xLSTM towards these domains and propose a suite of architectural
variants called Bio-xLSTM. Extensive experiments in three large domains,
genomics, proteins, and chemistry, were performed to assess xLSTM's ability to

responses, and in some cases, they may encourage users to engage in dangerous
behavior. To address this issue in the field of chemistry, we introduce
ChemSafetyBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the accuracy and safety of
LLM responses. ChemSafetyBench encompasses three key tasks: querying chemical
properties, assessing the legality of chemical uses, and describing synthesis
methods, each requiring increasingly deeper chemical knowledge. Our dataset has
more than 30K samples across various chemical materials. We incorporate
handcrafted templates and advanced jailbreaking scenarios to enhance task
diversity. Our automated evaluation framework thoroughly assesses the safety,
accuracy, and appropriateness of LLM responses. Extensive experiments with
state-of-the-art LLMs reveal notable strengths and critical vulnerabilities,
underscoring the need for robust safety measures. ChemSafetyBench aims to be a
pivotal tool in developing safer AI technologies in chemistry. Our code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/HaochenZhao/SafeAgent4Chem.

"Probing the limitations of multimodal language models for chemistry and
  materials research","Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have sparked interest in
scientific assistants that could support researchers across the full spectrum
of scientific workflows, from literature review to experimental design and data
analysis. A key capability for such systems is the ability to process and
reason about scientific information in both visual and textual forms - from
interpreting spectroscopic data to understanding laboratory setups. Here, we
introduce MaCBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating how
vision-language models handle real-world chemistry and materials science tasks
across three core aspects: data extraction, experimental understanding, and
results interpretation. Through a systematic evaluation of leading models, we
find that while these systems show promising capabilities in basic perception
tasks - achieving near-perfect performance in equipment identification and
standardized data extraction - they exhibit fundamental limitations in spatial
reasoning, cross-modal information synthesis, and multi-step logical inference.
Our insights have important implications beyond chemistry and materials
science, suggesting that developing reliable multimodal AI scientific
assistants may require advances in curating suitable training data and
approaches to training those models.",2024-11-25,2024,2024-11,chemistry
"Uni-Electrolyte: An Artificial Intelligence Platform for Designing
  Electrolyte Molecules for Rechargeable Batteries","Electrolyte is a very important part of rechargeable batteries such as
lithium batteries. However, the electrolyte innovation is facing grand
challenges due to the complicated solution chemistry and infinite molecular

intelligence (AI) platform, namely Uni-Electrolyte, for designing advanced
electrolyte molecules, which mainly includes three parts, i.e. EMolCurator,
EMolForger, and EMolNetKnittor. New molecules can be designed by combining
high-throughput screening and generative AI models from more than 100 million
alternative molecules in the EMolCurator module. The molecule properties
including frontier molecular orbital information, formation energy, binding
energy with a Li ion, viscosity, and dielectric constant, can be adopted as the
screening parameters. The EMolForger, and EMolNetKnittor module can predict the
retrosynthesis pathway and reaction pathway with electrodes for a given
molecule, respectively. With the assist of advanced AI methods, the

"ActPC-Chem: Discrete Active Predictive Coding for Goal-Guided
  Algorithmic Chemistry as a Potential Cognitive Kernel for Hyperon &
  PRIMUS-Based AGI","We explore a novel paradigm (labeled ActPC-Chem) for biologically inspired,
goal-guided artificial intelligence (AI) centered on a form of Discrete Active
Predictive Coding (ActPC) operating within an algorithmic chemistry of rewrite
rules. ActPC-Chem is envisioned as a foundational ""cognitive kernel"" for
advanced cognitive architectures, such as the OpenCog Hyperon system,
incorporating essential elements of the PRIMUS cognitive architecture. The
central thesis is that general-intelligence-capable cognitive structures and
dynamics can emerge in a system where both data and models are represented as
evolving patterns of metagraph rewrite rules, and where prediction errors,
intrinsic and extrinsic rewards, and semantic constraints guide the continual
reorganization and refinement of these rules. Using a virtual ""robot bug""
thought experiment, we illustrate how such a system might self-organize to
handle challenging tasks involving delayed and context-dependent rewards,
integrating causal rule inference (AIRIS) and probabilistic logical abstraction
(PLN) to discover and exploit conceptual patterns and causal constraints. Next,
we describe how continuous predictive coding neural networks, which excel at
handling noisy sensory data and motor control signals, can be coherently merged
with the discrete ActPC substrate. Finally, we outline how these ideas might be
extended to create a transformer-like architecture that foregoes traditional
backpropagation in favor of rule-based transformations guided by ActPC. This
layered architecture, supplemented with AIRIS and PLN, promises structured,
multi-modal, and logically consistent next-token predictions and narrative
sequences.",2024-12-21,2024,2024-12,chemistry
"""Did my figure do justice to the answer?"" : Towards Multimodal Short
  Answer Grading with Feedback (MMSAF)","Assessments play a vital role in a student's learning process by providing
feedback on a student's proficiency level in a subject. While assessments often
make use of short answer questions, it is often difficult to grade such
questions at a large scale. Moreover, such questions often involve students
drawing supporting diagrams along with their textual explanations. Such
questions often promote multimodal literacy and are aligned with
competency-based questions, which demand a deeper cognitive processing ability
from students. However, existing literature does not deal with the automatic
grading of such answers. Thus, to bridge this gap, we propose the Multimodal
Short Answer Grading with Feedback (MMSAF) problem along with a dataset of 2197
data points. Additionally, we provide an automated framework for generating
such datasets. Our evaluations on existing Large Language Models (LLMs) over
this dataset achieved an overall accuracy of 55% on the Level of Correctness

Steepest Ascent Hill Climbing For A Mathematical Problem,"The paper proposes artificial intelligence technique called hill climbing to
find numerical solutions of Diophantine Equations. Such equations are important
as they have many applications in fields like public key cryptography, integer
factorization, algebraic curves, projective curves and data dependency in super
computers. Importantly, it has been proved that there is no general method to
find solutions of such equations. This paper is an attempt to find numerical
solutions of Diophantine equations using steepest ascent version of Hill
Climbing. The method, which uses tree representation to depict possible
solutions of Diophantine equations, adopts a novel methodology to generate
successors. The heuristic function used help to make the process of finding
solution as a minimization process. The work illustrates the effectiveness of

studied, and theorems defining fellowship and conflicts in groups of robots are
proved. Also unitless parameters describing emotional states of those groups
are introduced, and a rule of making alternative (binary) decisions based on
emotional selection is given. We introduce a concept of equivalent educational
process for robots and a concept of efficiency coefficient of an educational

Unfair items detection in educational measurement,"Measurement professionals cannot come to an agreement on the definition of

is proposed. The more the unfairness measure deviates from zero, the less fair
the item is. If the measure exceeds the cutoff value, the item is identified as
definitely unfair. The new approach can identify unfair items that would not be

Isabelle/PIDE as Platform for Educational Tools,"The Isabelle/PIDE platform addresses the question whether proof assistants of
the LCF family are suitable as technological basis for educational tools. The
traditionally strong logical foundations of systems like HOL, Coq, or Isabelle
have so far been counter-balanced by somewhat inaccessible interaction via the
TTY (or minor variations like the well-known Proof General / Emacs interface).
Thus the fundamental question of math education tools with fully-formal
background theories has often been answered negatively due to accidental
weaknesses of existing proof engines.
  The idea of ""PIDE"" (which means ""Prover IDE"") is to integrate existing
provers like Isabelle into a larger environment, that facilitates access by
end-users and other tools. We use Scala to expose the proof engine in ML to the
JVM world, where many user-interfaces, editor frameworks, and educational tools

RAPID: A Reachable Anytime Planner for Imprecisely-sensed Domains,"Despite the intractability of generic optimal partially observable Markov
decision process planning, there exist important problems that have highly

more efficient algorithms for factored domains, and for domains with
topological structure in the flat state dynamics model. In our work, motivated
by findings from the education community relevant to automated tutoring, we
consider problems that exhibit a form of topological structure in the factored
dynamics model. Our Reachable Anytime Planner for Imprecisely-sensed Domains
(RAPID) leverages this structure to efficiently compute a good initial envelope
of reachable states under the optimal MDP policy in time linear in the number
of state variables. RAPID performs partially-observable planning over the
limited envelope of states, and slowly expands the state space considered as
time allows. RAPID performs well on a large tutoring-inspired problem

eTutor: Online Learning for Personalized Education,"Given recent advances in information technology and artificial intelligence,
web-based education systems have became complementary and, in some cases,
viable alternatives to traditional classroom teaching. The popularity of these
systems stems from their ability to make education available to a large
demographics (see MOOCs). However, existing systems do not take advantage of
the personalization which becomes possible when web-based education is offered:
they continue to be one-size-fits-all. In this paper, we aim to provide a first
systematic method for designing a personalized web-based education system.
Personalizing education is challenging: (i) students need to be provided
personalized teaching and training depending on their contexts (e.g. classes
already taken, methods of learning preferred, etc.), (ii) for each specific
context, the best teaching and training method (e.g type and order of teaching
materials to be shown) must be learned, (iii) teaching and training should be
adapted online, based on the scores/feedback (e.g. tests, quizzes, final exam,
likes/dislikes etc.) of the students. Our personalized online system, e-Tutor,
is able to address these challenges by learning how to adapt the teaching
methodology (in this case what sequence of teaching material to present to a
student) to maximize her performance in the final exam, while minimizing the
time spent by the students to learn the course (and possibly dropouts). We
illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method on a real-world eTutor

methods in that they do not require the explicit encoding of human domain
knowledge, and can capture more complex representations of student knowledge.
Using neural networks results in substantial improvements in prediction
performance on a range of knowledge tracing datasets. Moreover the learned

a student instead of self-perception questionnaires; ii) it handles uncertainty
with regard to each student's predominant team role; iii) it is iterative since
it considers information from several interactions in order to improve the

Ontology based system to guide internship assignment process,"Internship assignment is a complicated process for universities since it is
necessary to take into account a multiplicity of variables to establish a
compromise between companies' requirements and student competencies acquired

scheme. In this research a domain ontological model is presented as support to
the student's decision making for opportunities of University studies level of
the University Lumiere Lyon 2 (ULL) education system. The ontology is designed
and created using methodological approach offering the possibility of improving
the progressive creation, capture and knowledge articulation. In this paper, we
draw a balance taking the demands of the companies across the capabilities of

"Team Formation for Scheduling Educational Material in Massive Online
  Classes","Whether teaching in a classroom or a Massive Online Open Course it is crucial
to present the material in a way that benefits the audience as a whole. We
identify two important tasks to solve towards this objective, 1 group students
so that they can maximally benefit from peer interaction and 2 find an optimal
schedule of the educational material for each group. Thus, in this paper, we
solve the problem of team formation and content scheduling for education. Given
a time frame d, a set of students S with their required need to learn different
activities T and given k as the number of desired groups, we study the problem
of finding k group of students. The goal is to teach students within time frame
d such that their potential for learning is maximized and find the best
schedule for each group. We show this problem to be NP-hard and develop a
polynomial algorithm for it. We show our algorithm to be effective both on

expectation regarding the capabilities and intelligence of such systems has
also grown. We have become a more complicated society with more complicated
problems. As the expectation of intelligent systems rises, we discover many
more applications for artificial intelligence. Additionally, as the difficulty
level and computational requirements of such problems rise, there is a need to
distribute the problem solving. Although the field of multiagent systems (MAS)

"Object-Oriented Sokoban Solver: A Serious Game Project for OOAD and AI
  Education","Serious games are beneficial for education in various computer science areas.
Numerous works have reported the experiences of using games (not only playing

Difficulty-level Modeling of Ontology-based Factual Questions,"Semantics based knowledge representations such as ontologies are found to be

factual questions are very simple and are limited to a few basic principles. We
propose a new methodology for this problem by considering an educational theory
called Item Response Theory (IRT). In the IRT, knowledge proficiency of end
users (learners) are considered for assigning difficulty levels, because of the
assumptions that a given question is perceived differently by learners of
various proficiencies. We have done a detailed study on the features (factors)

Learning to Rank based on Analogical Reasoning,"Object ranking or ""learning to rank"" is an important problem in the realm of
preference learning. On the basis of training data in the form of a set of
rankings of objects represented as feature vectors, the goal is to learn a
ranking function that predicts a linear order of any new set of objects. In
this paper, we propose a new approach to object ranking based on principles of
analogical reasoning. More specifically, our inference pattern is formalized in
terms of so-called analogical proportions and can be summarized as follows:
Given objects $A,B,C,D$, if object $A$ is known to be preferred to $B$, and $C$
relates to $D$ as $A$ relates to $B$, then $C$ is (supposedly) preferred to
$D$. Our method applies this pattern as a main building block and combines it
with ideas and techniques from instance-based learning and rank aggregation.
Based on first experimental results for data sets from various domains (sports,
education, tourism, etc.), we conclude that our approach is highly competitive.
It appears to be specifically interesting in situations in which the objects
are coming from different subdomains, and which hence require a kind of
knowledge transfer.",2017-11-28,2017,2017-11,education
Happiness Pursuit: Personality Learning in a Society of Agents,"Modeling personality is a challenging problem with applications spanning
computer games, virtual assistants, online shopping and education. Many
techniques have been tried, ranging from neural networks to computational
cognitive architectures. However, most approaches rely on examples with
hand-crafted features and scenarios. Here, we approach learning a personality
by training agents using a Deep Q-Network (DQN) model on rewards based on
psychoanalysis, against hand-coded AI in the game of Pong. As a result, we
obtain 4 agents, each with its own personality. Then, we define happiness of an
agent, which can be seen as a measure of alignment with agent's objective
function, and study it when agents play both against hand-coded AI, and against
each other. We find that the agents that achieve higher happiness during
testing against hand-coded AI, have lower happiness when competing against each
other. This suggests that higher happiness in testing is a sign of overfitting
in learning to interact with hand-coded AI, and leads to worse performance
against agents with different personalities.",2017-11-29,2017,2017-11,education
"Towards the Augmented Pathologist: Challenges of Explainable-AI in

intelligence/machine learning enable to make novel information accessible and
quantifiable to a human expert, which is not yet available and not exploited in
current medical settings. The grand goal is to reach a level of usable
intelligence to understand the data in the context of an application task,
thereby making machine decisions transparent, interpretable and explainable.
The foundation of such an ""augmented pathologist"" needs an integrated approach:
While machine learning algorithms require many thousands of training examples,
a human expert is often confronted with only a few data points. Interestingly,
humans can learn from such few examples and are able to instantly interpret
complex patterns. Consequently, the grand goal is to combine the possibilities
of artificial intelligence with human intelligence and to find a well-suited
balance between them to enable what neither of them could do on their own. This

However, existing approaches do not support modeling of flexible instructional

data from a conventional test and an item response theory. First, we apply a
GS-based parameter estimation mechanism to estimate the items parameters
according to the response data, and then to compare its results with those of
an IRT-based Bayesian parameter estimation mechanism. In addition, we propose a
static-IRT test assembly mechanism to assemble a form for the conventional

probability of making a correct response to the item for a student with various
abilities. Moreover, this paper also proposes a novel PFML learning mechanism
for optimizing the parameters between items and students. Finally, we adopt a
K-fold cross validation mechanism to evaluate the performance of the proposed
agent. Experimental results show that the novel PFML learning mechanism for the
parameter estimation and learning optimization performs favorably. We believe

well-established hypotheses in educational psychology and incorporates them
inside of a scalable software architecture. Specifically, we build upon the
known benefits of knowledge vocalization, parallel learning, and immediate
feedback in the context of student learning. We show that open-source data
combined with state-of-the-art techniques in deep learning and natural language
processing can apply the benefits of these three factors at scale, while still
operating at the granularity of individual student needs and recommendations.
Additionally, we allow teachers to retain full control of the outputs of the
algorithms, and provide student statistics to help better guide classroom
discussions towards topics that would benefit from more in-person review and
coverage. Our experiments and pilot programs show promising results, and cement
our hypothesis that the system is flexible enough to serve a wide variety of
purposes in both classroom and classroom-free settings.",2018-10-17,2018,2018-10,education
Knowledge Tracing Machines: Factorization Machines for Knowledge Tracing,"Knowledge tracing is a sequence prediction problem where the goal is to
predict the outcomes of students over questions as they are interacting with a
learning platform. By tracking the evolution of the knowledge of some student,
one can optimize instruction. Existing methods are either based on temporal
latent variable models, or factor analysis with temporal features. We here show
that factorization machines (FMs), a model for regression or classification,
encompasses several existing models in the educational literature as special
cases, notably additive factor model, performance factor model, and
multidimensional item response theory. We show, using several real datasets of
tens of thousands of users and items, that FMs can estimate student knowledge
accurately and fast even when student data is sparsely observed, and handle
side information such as multiple knowledge components and number of attempts
at item or skill level. Our approach allows to fit student models of higher
dimension than existing models, and provides a testbed to try new combinations
of features in order to improve existing models.",2018-11-08,2018,2018-11,education
50 Years of Test (Un)fairness: Lessons for Machine Learning,"Quantitative definitions of what is unfair and what is fair have been
introduced in multiple disciplines for well over 50 years, including in
education, hiring, and machine learning. We trace how the notion of fairness
has been defined within the testing communities of education and hiring over
the past half century, exploring the cultural and social context in which
different fairness definitions have emerged. In some cases, earlier definitions
of fairness are similar or identical to definitions of fairness in current
machine learning research, and foreshadow current formal work. In other cases,
insights into what fairness means and how to measure it have largely gone
overlooked. We compare past and current notions of fairness along several
dimensions, including the fairness criteria, the focus of the criteria (e.g., a
test, a model, or its use), the relationship of fairness to individuals,
groups, and subgroups, and the mathematical method for measuring fairness
(e.g., classification, regression). This work points the way towards future
research and measurement of (un)fairness that builds from our modern
understanding of fairness while incorporating insights from the past.",2018-11-25,2018,2018-11,education
"What Should I Learn First: Introducing LectureBank for NLP Education and
  Prerequisite Chain Learning","Recent years have witnessed the rising popularity of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) and related fields such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
Machine Learning (ML). Many online courses and resources are available even for
those without a strong background in the field. Often the student is curious
about a specific topic but does not quite know where to begin studying. To
answer the question of ""what should one learn first,"" we apply an
embedding-based method to learn prerequisite relations for course concepts in
the domain of NLP. We introduce LectureBank, a dataset containing 1,352 English
lecture files collected from university courses which are each classified
according to an existing taxonomy as well as 208 manually-labeled prerequisite
relation topics, which is publicly available. The dataset will be useful for
educational purposes such as lecture preparation and organization as well as
applications such as reading list generation. Additionally, we experiment with

concept prerequisite relations. PREREQ is designed using latent representations
of concepts obtained from the Pairwise Latent Dirichlet Allocation model, and a
neural network based on the Siamese network architecture. PREREQ can learn
unknown concept prerequisites from course prerequisites and labeled concept
prerequisite data. It outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on benchmark
datasets and can effectively learn from very less training data. PREREQ can
also use unlabeled video playlists, a steadily growing source of training data,
to learn concept prerequisites, thus obviating the need for manual annotation

"Transparent Machine Education of Neural Networks for Swarm Shepherding
  Using Curriculum Design","Swarm control is a difficult problem due to the need to guide a large number
of agents simultaneously. We cast the problem as a shepherding problem, similar
to biological dogs guiding a group of sheep towards a goal. The shepherd needs
to deal with complex and dynamic environments and make decisions in order to
direct the swarm from one location to another. In this paper, we design a novel
curriculum to teach an artificial intelligence empowered agent to shepherd in
the presence of the large state space associated with the shepherding problem

curriculum could indeed enhance the speed of learning and the complexity of

"Machine Teaching in Hierarchical Genetic Reinforcement Learning:
  Curriculum Design of Reward Functions for Swarm Shepherding","The design of reward functions in reinforcement learning is a human skill
that comes with experience. Unfortunately, there is not any methodology in the
literature that could guide a human to design the reward function or to allow a
human to transfer the skills developed in designing reward functions to another
human and in a systematic manner. In this paper, we use Systematic
Instructional Design, an approach in human education, to engineer a machine
education methodology to design reward functions for reinforcement learning. We
demonstrate the methodology in designing a hierarchical genetic reinforcement
learner that adopts a neural network representation to evolve a swarm
controller for an agent shepherding a boids-based swarm. The results reveal
that the methodology is able to guide the design of hierarchical reinforcement
learners, with each model in the hierarchy learning incrementally through a
multi-part reward function. The hierarchy acts as a decision fusion function
that combines the individual behaviours and skills learnt by each instruction
to create a smart shepherd to control the swarm.",2019-01-04,2019,2019-01,education
Analogy-Based Preference Learning with Kernels,"Building on a specific formalization of analogical relationships of the form
""A relates to B as C relates to D"", we establish a connection between two
important subfields of artificial intelligence, namely analogical reasoning and
kernel-based machine learning. More specifically, we show that so-called
analogical proportions are closely connected to kernel functions on pairs of
objects. Based on this result, we introduce the analogy kernel, which can be
seen as a measure of how strongly four objects are in analogical relationship.
As an application, we consider the problem of object ranking in the realm of
preference learning, for which we develop a new method based on support vector
machines trained with the analogy kernel. Our first experimental results for
data sets from different domains (sports, education, tourism, etc.) are
promising and suggest that our approach is competitive to state-of-the-art
algorithms in terms of predictive accuracy.",2019-01-07,2019,2019-01,education
"Solving The Exam Scheduling Problems in Central Exams With Genetic

the test session were assigned to examination rooms. Purposes of the study are
increasing the number of joint students participating in sessions, using the
minimum number of buildings in the same session, and reducing the number of
supervisors using the minimum number of classrooms possible. In this study, a

"Emotion Recognition in Conversation: Research Challenges, Datasets, and

the plethora of publicly available conversational data in platforms such as
Facebook, Youtube, Reddit, Twitter, and others. Moreover, it has potential
applications in health-care systems (as a tool for psychological analysis),
education (understanding student frustration) and more. Additionally, ERC is
also extremely important for generating emotion-aware dialogues that require an
understanding of the user's emotions. Catering to these needs calls for
effective and scalable conversational emotion-recognition algorithms. However,

"Digital Normativity: A challenge for human subjectivization and free

help humans making decisions in a world of increasing complexity. Yet, the
effectiveness of algorithms in bringing more and more relevant recommendations
to humans may start to compete with human-alone decisions based on values other
than pure efficacy. Here, we examine this tension in light of the emergence of
several forms of digital normativity, and analyze how this normative role of AI
may influence the ability of humans to remain subject of their life. The advent
of AI technology imposes a need to achieve a balance between concrete material
progress and progress of the mind to avoid any form of servitude. It has become

"A Self-Attention Joint Model for Spoken Language Understanding in
  Situational Dialog Applications","Spoken language understanding (SLU) acts as a critical component in

grammatically, solve ID and SF independently, or do not fully utilize the
mutual impact of the two tasks. This paper proposes a multi-head self-attention
joint model with a conditional random field (CRF) layer and a prior mask. The
experiments show the effectiveness of our model, as compared with
state-of-the-art models. Meanwhile, online education in China has made great
progress in the last few years. But there are few intelligent educational

"A Survey on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI): Towards Medical
  XAI","Recently, artificial intelligence and machine learning in general have
demonstrated remarkable performances in many tasks, from image processing to
natural language processing, especially with the advent of deep learning. Along
with research progress, they have encroached upon many different fields and

transparency, for example the medical sector. Explanations for machine
decisions and predictions are thus needed to justify their reliability. This
requires greater interpretability, which often means we need to understand the
mechanism underlying the algorithms. Unfortunately, the blackbox nature of the
deep learning is still unresolved, and many machine decisions are still poorly
understood. We provide a review on interpretabilities suggested by different
research works and categorize them. The different categories show different
dimensions in interpretability research, from approaches that provide
""obviously"" interpretable information to the studies of complex patterns. By
applying the same categorization to interpretability in medical research, it is

However, in addition to sequential information, questions inherently exhibit
side relations, which can enrich our understandings about student knowledge

derive answers through textual comprehension methods. Due to their inability to
capture the pedagogical meaning of textual content, these models are not
appropriately suited to the educational field for pedagogy. In this paper, we
propose an on-the-fly conceptual network model that incorporates educational
semantics. The proposed model preserves correlations between conceptual
entities by applying intelligent indexing algorithms on the concept network so
as to improve answer generation. This model can be utilized for building
interactive conversational agents for aiding classroom learning.",2019-11-12,2019,2019-11,education
Joint Embedding Learning of Educational Knowledge Graphs,"As an efficient model for knowledge organization, the knowledge graph has
been widely adopted in several fields, e.g., biomedicine, sociology, and
education. And there is a steady trend of learning embedding representations of
knowledge graphs to facilitate knowledge graph construction and downstream
tasks. In general, knowledge graph embedding techniques aim to learn vectorized
representations which preserve the structural information of the graph. And
conventional embedding learning models rely on structural relationships among
entities and relations. However, in educational knowledge graphs, structural
relationships are not the focus. Instead, rich literals of the graphs are more
valuable. In this paper, we focus on this problem and propose a novel model for
embedding learning of educational knowledge graphs. Our model considers both
structural and literal information and jointly learns embedding
representations. Three experimental graphs were constructed based on an
educational knowledge graph which has been applied in real-world teaching. We
conducted two experiments on the three graphs and other common benchmark
graphs. The experimental results proved the effectiveness of our model and its
superiority over other baselines when processing educational knowledge graphs.",2019-11-20,2019,2019-11,education
"TrueLearn: A Family of Bayesian Algorithms to Match Lifelong Learners to
  Open Educational Resources","The recent advances in computer-assisted learning systems and the
availability of open educational resources today promise a pathway to providing
cost-efficient, high-quality education to large masses of learners. One of the
most ambitious use cases of computer-assisted learning is to build a lifelong
learning recommendation system. Unlike short-term courses, lifelong learning
presents unique challenges, requiring sophisticated recommendation models that
account for a wide range of factors such as background knowledge of learners or
novelty of the material while effectively maintaining knowledge states of
masses of learners for significantly longer periods of time (ideally, a
lifetime). This work presents the foundations towards building a dynamic,
scalable and transparent recommendation system for education, modelling
learner's knowledge from implicit data in the form of engagement with open
educational resources. We i) use a text ontology based on Wikipedia to
automatically extract knowledge components of educational resources and, ii)
propose a set of online Bayesian strategies inspired by the well-known areas of
item response theory and knowledge tracing. Our proposal, TrueLearn, focuses on
recommendations for which the learner has enough background knowledge (so they
are able to understand and learn from the material), and the material has
enough novelty that would help the learner improve their knowledge about the
subject and keep them engaged. We further construct a large open educational
video lectures dataset and test the performance of the proposed algorithms,
which show clear promise towards building an effective educational
recommendation system.",2019-11-21,2019,2019-11,education
Towards an Integrative Educational Recommender for Lifelong Learners,"One of the most ambitious use cases of computer-assisted learning is to build
a recommendation system for lifelong learning. Most recommender algorithms
exploit similarities between content and users, overseeing the necessity to
leverage sensible learning trajectories for the learner. Lifelong learning thus
presents unique challenges, requiring scalable and transparent models that can
account for learner knowledge and content novelty simultaneously, while also
retaining accurate learners representations for long periods of time. We
attempt to build a novel educational recommender, that relies on an integrative
approach combining multiple drivers of learners engagement. Our first step
towards this goal is TrueLearn, which models content novelty and background
knowledge of learners and achieves promising performance while retaining a
human interpretable learner model.",2019-12-03,2019,2019-12,education
EdNet: A Large-Scale Hierarchical Dataset in Education,"With advances in Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIEd) and the
ever-growing scale of Interactive Educational Systems (IESs), data-driven
approach has become a common recipe for various tasks such as knowledge tracing
and learning path recommendation. Unfortunately, collecting real students'
interaction data is often challenging, which results in the lack of public
large-scale benchmark dataset reflecting a wide variety of student behaviors in
modern IESs. Although several datasets, such as ASSISTments, Junyi Academy,
Synthetic and STATICS, are publicly available and widely used, they are not
large enough to leverage the full potential of state-of-the-art data-driven
models and limits the recorded behaviors to question-solving activities. To
this end, we introduce EdNet, a large-scale hierarchical dataset of diverse
student activities collected by Santa, a multi-platform self-study solution
equipped with artificial intelligence tutoring system. EdNet contains
131,441,538 interactions from 784,309 students collected over more than 2
years, which is the largest among the ITS datasets released to the public so
far. Unlike existing datasets, EdNet provides a wide variety of student actions
ranging from question-solving to lecture consumption and item purchasing. Also,
EdNet has a hierarchical structure where the student actions are divided into 4
different levels of abstractions. The features of EdNet are domain-agnostic,
allowing EdNet to be extended to different domains easily. The dataset is
publicly released under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0
International license for research purposes. We plan to host challenges in
multiple AIEd tasks with EdNet to provide a common ground for the fair
comparison between different state of the art models and encourage the
development of practical and effective methods.",2019-12-06,2019,2019-12,education
"Assessment Modeling: Fundamental Pre-training Tasks for Interactive
  Educational Systems","Like many other domains in Artificial Intelligence (AI), there are specific
tasks in the field of AI in Education (AIEd) for which labels are scarce and
expensive, such as predicting exam score or review correctness. A common way of
circumventing label-scarce problems is pre-training a model to learn
representations of the contents of learning items. However, such methods fail
to utilize the full range of student interaction data available and do not
model student learning behavior. To this end, we propose Assessment Modeling, a
class of fundamental pre-training tasks for general interactive educational
systems. An assessment is a feature of student-system interactions which can
serve as a pedagogical evaluation. Examples include the correctness and
timeliness of a student's answer. Assessment Modeling is the prediction of
assessments conditioned on the surrounding context of interactions. Although it
is natural to pre-train on interactive features available in large amounts,
limiting the prediction targets to assessments focuses the tasks' relevance to
the label-scarce educational problems and reduces less-relevant noise. While
the effectiveness of different combinations of assessments is open for
exploration, we suggest Assessment Modeling as a first-order guiding principle
for selecting proper pre-training tasks for label-scarce educational problems.",2020-01-01,2020,2020-01,education
Algorithmic Fairness,"An increasing number of decisions regarding the daily lives of human beings
are being controlled by artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in spheres
ranging from healthcare, transportation, and education to college admissions,
recruitment, provision of loans and many more realms. Since they now touch on
many aspects of our lives, it is crucial to develop AI algorithms that are not
only accurate but also objective and fair. Recent studies have shown that
algorithmic decision-making may be inherently prone to unfairness, even when
there is no intention for it. This paper presents an overview of the main
concepts of identifying, measuring and improving algorithmic fairness when
using AI algorithms. The paper begins by discussing the causes of algorithmic
bias and unfairness and the common definitions and measures for fairness.
Fairness-enhancing mechanisms are then reviewed and divided into pre-process,
in-process and post-process mechanisms. A comprehensive comparison of the
mechanisms is then conducted, towards a better understanding of which
mechanisms should be used in different scenarios. The paper then describes the
most commonly used fairness-related datasets in this field. Finally, the paper
ends by reviewing several emerging research sub-fields of algorithmic fairness.",2020-01-21,2020,2020-01,education

this tutorial, we take the Hopfield network as an example to show how the
confluence of these fields can dramatically accelerate physics-based computer
simulations and remove technical barriers in implementing such programs,
thereby making physics experimentation and education faster and more
accessible. To do so, we introduce the cloud, the GPU, and AI frameworks that
can be easily repurposed for physics simulation. We then introduce the Hopfield

knowing, beforehand, the possible ways to solve a problem. Hence the need for
an automated theorem prover that provide proofs as they would be written by a

"Choose Your Own Question: Encouraging Self-Personalization in Learning
  Path Construction","Learning Path Recommendation is the heart of adaptive learning, the
educational paradigm of an Interactive Educational System (IES) providing a
personalized learning experience based on the student's history of learning
activities. In typical existing IESs, the student must fully consume a
recommended learning item to be provided a new recommendation. This workflow
comes with several limitations. For example, there is no opportunity for the
student to give feedback on the choice of learning items made by the IES.
Furthermore, the mechanism by which the choice is made is opaque to the
student, limiting the student's ability to track their learning. To this end,
we introduce Rocket, a Tinder-like User Interface for a general class of IESs.
Rocket provides a visual representation of Artificial Intelligence
(AI)-extracted features of learning materials, allowing the student to quickly
decide whether the material meets their needs. The student can choose between
engaging with the material and receiving a new recommendation by swiping or
tapping. Rocket offers the following potential improvements for IES User
Interfaces: First, Rocket enhances the explainability of IES recommendations by
showing students a visual summary of the meaningful AI-extracted features used
in the decision-making process. Second, Rocket enables self-personalization of
the learning experience by leveraging the students' knowledge of their own
abilities and needs. Finally, Rocket provides students with fine-grained
information on their learning path, giving them an avenue to assess their own
skills and track their learning progress. We present the source code of Rocket,

Siamese Neural Networks for Class Activity Detection,"Classroom activity detection (CAD) aims at accurately recognizing speaker

classroom recordings may be very noisy and low-quality. In this work, we
address the above challenges by building a Siamese neural framework to
automatically identify teacher and student utterances from classroom
recordings. The proposed model is evaluated on real-world educational datasets.
The results demonstrate that (1) our approach is superior on the prediction
tasks for both online and offline classroom environments; and (2) our framework

that automatically detects questions from teachers' audio recordings. Compared
with traditional methods, our approach not only avoids cumbersome feature
engineering, but also adapts to the task of multi-class question detection in
real education scenarios. By incorporating multi-task learning techniques, we

Predicting Engagement in Video Lectures,"The explosion of Open Educational Resources (OERs) in the recent years

Learner engagement, is arguably a more reliable measure than popularity/number
of views, is more abundant than user ratings and has also been shown to be a
crucial component in achieving learning outcomes. In this work, we explore the
idea of building a predictive model for population-based engagement in
education. We introduce a novel, large dataset of video lectures for predicting
context-agnostic engagement and propose both cross-modal and modality-specific
feature sets to achieve this task. We further test different strategies for

"Disparate Impact of Artificial Intelligence Bias in Ridehailing
  Economy's Price Discrimination Algorithms","Ridehailing applications that collect mobility data from individuals to
inform smart city planning predict each trip's fare pricing with automated
algorithms that rely on artificial intelligence (AI). This type of AI
algorithm, namely a price discrimination algorithm, is widely used in the
industry's black box systems for dynamic individualized pricing. Lacking
transparency, studying such AI systems for fairness and disparate impact has
not been possible without access to data used in generating the outcomes of
price discrimination algorithms. Recently, in an effort to enhance transparency
in city planning, the city of Chicago regulation mandated that transportation
providers publish anonymized data on ridehailing. As a result, we present the
first large-scale measurement of the disparate impact of price discrimination
algorithms used by ridehailing applications.
  The application of random effects models from the meta-analysis literature
combines the city-level effects of AI bias on fare pricing from census tract
attributes, aggregated from the American Community Survey. An analysis of 100
million ridehailing samples from the city of Chicago indicates a significant
disparate impact in fare pricing of neighborhoods due to AI bias learned from
ridehailing utilization patterns associated with demographic attributes.
Neighborhoods with larger non-white populations, higher poverty levels, younger
residents, and high education levels are significantly associated with higher
fare prices, with combined effect sizes, measured in Cohen's d, of -0.32,
-0.28, 0.69, and 0.24 for each demographic, respectively. Further, our methods

"Measuring the Credibility of Student Attendance Data in Higher Education
  for Data Mining","Educational Data Mining (EDM) is a developing discipline, concerned with
expanding the classical Data Mining (DM) methods and developing new methods for
discovering the data that originate from educational systems. Student
attendance in higher education has always been dealt with in a classical way,
educators rely on counting the occurrence of attendance or absence building
their knowledge about students as well as modules based on this count. This
method is neither credible nor does it necessarily provide a real indication of
a student performance. This study tries to formulate the extracted knowledge in
a way that guarantees achieving accurate and credible results. Student
attendance data, gathered from the educational system, were first cleaned in
order to remove any randomness and noise, then various attributes were studied
so as to highlight the most significant ones that affect the real attendance of
students. The next step was to derive an equation that measures the Student
Attendance Credibility (SAC) considering the attributes chosen in the previous
step. The reliability of the newly developed measure was then evaluated in
order to examine its consistency. Finally, the J48 DM classification technique
was utilized in order to classify modules based on the strength of their SAC
values. Results of this study were promising, and credibility values achieved

"Teaching Tech to Talk: K-12 Conversational Artificial Intelligence
  Literacy Curriculum and Development Tools","With children talking to smart-speakers, smart-phones and even
smart-microwaves daily, it is increasingly important to educate students on how
these agents work-from underlying mechanisms to societal implications.
Researchers are developing tools and curriculum to teach K-12 students broadly
about artificial intelligence (AI); however, few studies have evaluated these
tools with respect to AI-specific learning outcomes, and even fewer have
addressed student learning about AI-based conversational agents. We evaluate
our Conversational Agent Interface for MIT App Inventor and workshop curriculum
with respect to eight AI competencies from the literature. Furthermore, we
analyze teacher (n=9) and student (n=47) feedback from workshops with the
interface and recommend that future work leverages design considerations from
the literature to optimize engagement, collaborates with teachers, and
addresses a range of student abilities through pacing and opportunities for
extension. We found students struggled most with the concepts of AI ethics and
learning, and recommend emphasizing these topics when teaching.

"Designing AI Learning Experiences for K-12: Emerging Works, Future
  Opportunities and a Design Framework","Artificial intelligence (AI) literacy is a rapidly growing research area and
a critical addition to K-12 education. However, support for designing tools and
curriculum to teach K-12 AI literacy is still limited. There is a need for
additional interdisciplinary human-computer interaction and education research
investigating (1) how general AI literacy is currently implemented in learning
experiences and (2) what additional guidelines are required to teach AI
literacy in specifically K-12 learning contexts. In this paper, we analyze a
collection of K-12 AI and education literature to show how core competencies of
AI literacy are applied successfully and organize them into an
educator-friendly chart to enable educators to efficiently find appropriate
resources for their classrooms. We also identify future opportunities and K-12

workshops with 15 K-12 teachers to identify opportunities to integrate AI
education into core curriculum to leverage learners' interests. During the
co-design workshops, teachers and researchers co-created lesson plans where AI
concepts were embedded into various core subjects. We found that K-12 teachers
need additional scaffolding in the curriculum to facilitate ethics and data
discussions, and value supports for learner engagement, collaboration, and

fulfilled with intelligent systems that sense their environment, make proactive
decisions on actions advancing their goals, and perform the actions on the
environment. We emphasize artificial intelligence, feedback loops, human
acceptance and control, intelligent use of basic resources, performance
parameters, mission-oriented interdisciplinary research, and a holistic systems
view complementing the conventional analytical reductive view as a research
paradigm especially for complex problems. To serve a broad audience, we explain
these concepts and list the essential literature. We suggest planning research
and education by specifying, in a step-wise manner, scenarios, performance
criteria, system models, research problems and education content, resulting in
common goals and a coherent project portfolio as well as education curricula.

"Meta-Heuristic Solutions to a Student Grouping Optimization Problem
  faced in Higher Education Institutions","Combinatorial problems which have been proven to be NP-hard are faced in
Higher Education Institutions and researches have extensively investigated some
of the well-known combinatorial problems such as the timetabling and student
project allocation problems. However, NP-hard problems faced in Higher
Education Institutions are not only confined to these categories of
combinatorial problems. The majority of NP-hard problems faced in institutions
involve grouping students and/or resources, albeit with each problem having its
own unique set of constraints. Thus, it can be argued that techniques to solve
NP-hard problems in Higher Education Institutions can be transferred across the
different problem categories. As no method is guaranteed to outperform all
others in all problems, it is necessary to investigate heuristic techniques for
solving lesser-known problems in order to guide stakeholders or software
developers to the most appropriate algorithm for each unique class of NP-hard
problems faced in Higher Education Institutions. To this end, this study
described an optimization problem faced in a real university that involved
grouping students for the presentation of semester results. Ordering based
heuristics, genetic algorithm and the ant colony optimization algorithm
implemented in Python programming language were used to find feasible solutions
to this problem, with the ant colony optimization algorithm performing better

better or equal results in 38% of the test instances.",2020-10-01,2020,2020-10,education
Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis in Education Domain,"Analysis of a large amount of data has always brought value to institutions

a very important aspect of this analysis. In response to this challenge, a
natural language processing technique known as Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis

of opinions separately, ABSA has found itself useful in a wide range of
domains. Education is one of the domains in which ABSA can be successfully
utilized. Being able to understand and find out what students like and don't
like most about a course, professor, or teaching methodology can be of great
importance for the respective institutions. While this task represents a unique
NLP challenge, many studies have proposed different approaches to tackle the

recognising this very singular situation, and accepted our proposal of
organising a special issue with papers submitted to ThEdu'20. An open call for
papers was then issued, and attracted five submissions, all of which have been
accepted by our reviewers, who produced three careful reports on each of the
contributions. The resulting revised papers are collected in the present
volume. We, the volume editors, hope that this collection of papers will help
further promoting the development of theorem-proving-based software, and that
it will collaborate to improve the mutual understanding between computer
mathematicians and stakeholders in education. With some luck, we would actually
expect that the very special circumstances set up by the worst sanitary crisis

this paper, we propose a novel Personalized Multimodal Feedback Generation
Network (PMFGN) armed with a modality gate mechanism and a personalized bias

Automated Large-scale Class Scheduling in MiniZinc,"Class Scheduling is a highly constrained task. Educational institutes spend a

availability of course teachers on the given slots. With the added limitation
of available classrooms, the number of solutions satisfying all constraints in
this huge search-space, further decreases.
  This paper proposes an efficient system to generate class schedules that can
fulfill every possible need of a typical university. Though it is primarily a

programming their own conversational agents in week-long AI education
workshops. Specifically, we investigate the workshops' influence on student
perceptions of Alexa's intelligence, friendliness, aliveness, safeness,
trustworthiness, human-likeness, and feelings of closeness. We found that
students felt Alexa was more intelligent and felt closer to Alexa after the
workshops. We also found strong correlations between students' perceptions of
Alexa's friendliness and trustworthiness, and safeness and trustworthiness.
Finally, we explored how students tended to more frequently use computer
science-related diction and ideas after the workshops. Based on our findings,
we recommend designers carefully consider personification, transparency,
playfulness and utility when designing CAs for learning contexts.",2021-02-02,2021,2021-02,education
"Artificial Intelligence Technologies in Education: Benefits, Challenges
  and Strategies of Implementation","Since the education sector is associated with highly dynamic business
environments which are controlled and maintained by information systems, recent
technological advancements and the increasing pace of adopting artificial
intelligence (AI) technologies constitute a need to identify and analyze the
issues regarding their implementation in education sector. However, a study of
the contemporary literature reveled that relatively little research has been
undertaken in this area. To fill this void, we have identified the benefits and
challenges of implementing artificial intelligence in the education sector,
preceded by a short discussion on the concepts of AI and its evolution over
time. Moreover, we have also reviewed modern AI technologies for learners and
educators, currently available on the software market, evaluating their
usefulness. Last but not least, we have developed a strategy implementation
model, described by a five-stage, generic process, along with the corresponding
configuration guide. To verify and validate their design, we separately
developed three implementation strategies for three different higher education
organizations. We believe that the obtained results will contribute to better
understanding the specificities of AI systems, services and tools, and
afterwards pave a smooth way in their implementation.",2021-02-11,2021,2021-02,education
Engineering Education in the Age of Autonomous Machines,"In the past few years, we have observed a huge supply-demand gap for
autonomous driving engineers. The core problem is that autonomous driving is
not one single technology but rather a complex system integrating many
technologies, and no one single academic department can provide comprehensive
education in this field. We advocate to create a cross-disciplinary program to
expose students with technical background in computer science, computer
engineering, electrical engineering, as well as mechanical engineering. On top
of the cross-disciplinary technical foundation, a capstone project that
provides students with hands-on experiences of working with a real autonomous
vehicle is required to consolidate the technical foundation.",2021-02-16,2021,2021-02,education

has become a state-of-the-art technique for combinatorial games, however, in
more complex games (e.g. those with high branching factor or real-time ones),
as well as in various practical domains (e.g. transportation, scheduling or

Designing for human-AI complementarity in K-12 education,"Recent work has explored how complementary strengths of humans and artificial

students learn more when teachers and AI tutors work together during class. We
discuss implications of this research for the design of human-AI partnerships.
We argue for more participatory approaches to research and design in this area,

AI is an increasingly powerful tool with potential for good, albeit one with a
high risk of negative side-effects that go against fundamental human rights and
UN values. It explains the need for ethical principles for AI aligned with
principles for data governance, as data and AI are tightly interwoven. It
explores different ethical frameworks that exist and tools such as assessment

Accelerating science with human versus alien artificial intelligences,"Data-driven artificial intelligence models fed with published scientific
findings have been used to create powerful prediction engines for scientific
and technological advance, such as the discovery of novel materials with
desired properties and the targeted invention of new therapies and vaccines.
These AI approaches typically ignore the distribution of human prediction
engines -- scientists and inventor -- who continuously alter the landscape of
discovery and invention. As a result, AI hypotheses are designed to substitute
for human experts, failing to complement them for punctuated collective
advance. Here we show that incorporating the distribution of human expertise
into self-supervised models by training on inferences cognitively available to
experts dramatically improves AI prediction of future human discoveries and
inventions. Including expert-awareness into models that propose (a) valuable
energy-relevant materials increases the precision of materials predictions by
~100%, (b) repurposing thousands of drugs to treat new diseases increases
precision by 43%, and (c) COVID-19 vaccine candidates examined in clinical
trials by 260%. These models succeed by predicting human predictions and the
scientists who will make them. By tuning AI to avoid the crowd, however, it
generates scientifically promising ""alien"" hypotheses unlikely to be imagined
or pursued without intervention, not only accelerating but punctuating
scientific advance. By identifying and correcting for collective human bias,
these models also suggest opportunities to improve human prediction by
reformulating science education for discovery.",2021-04-12,2021,2021-04,education

of one-on-one human tutoring to a broader audience, or by filling gaps in
existing educational services. Given these noble intentions, why might AIEd
systems have inequitable impacts in practice? In this chapter, we discuss four
lenses that can be used to examine how and why AIEd systems risk amplifying
existing inequities. Building from these lenses, we then outline possible paths

Towards Equity and Algorithmic Fairness in Student Grade Prediction,"Equity of educational outcome and fairness of AI with respect to race have
been topics of increasing importance in education. In this work, we address
both with empirical evaluations of grade prediction in higher education, an
important task to improve curriculum design, plan interventions for academic
support, and offer course guidance to students. With fairness as the aim, we
trial several strategies for both label and instance balancing to attempt to
minimize differences in algorithm performance with respect to race. We find
that an adversarial learning approach, combined with grade label balancing,
achieved by far the fairest results. With equity of educational outcome as the
aim, we trial strategies for boosting predictive performance on historically
underserved groups and find success in sampling those groups in inverse
proportion to their historic outcomes. With AI-infused technology supports
increasingly prevalent on campuses, our methodologies fill a need for
frameworks to consider performance trade-offs with respect to sensitive student

Modeling the EdNet Dataset with Logistic Regression,"Many of these challenges are won by neural network models created by

"Beyond ""Fairness:"" Structural (In)justice Lenses on AI for Education","Educational technologies, and the systems of schooling in which they are
deployed, enact particular ideologies about what is important to know and how
learners should learn. As artificial intelligence technologies -- in education

communities, various approaches have been developed to evaluate and mitigate
the harmful impacts of AI. However, we argue in this paper that the dominant
paradigm of evaluating fairness on the basis of performance disparities in AI
models is inadequate for confronting the systemic inequities that educational
AI systems (re)produce. We draw on a lens of structural injustice informed by
critical theory and Black feminist scholarship to critically interrogate
several widely-studied and widely-adopted categories of educational AI and
explore how they are bound up in and reproduce historical legacies of
structural injustice and inequity, regardless of the parity of their models'

Classifying Math KCs via Task-Adaptive Pre-Trained BERT,"Educational content labeled with proper knowledge components (KCs) are
particularly useful to teachers or content organizers. However, manually
labeling educational content is labor intensive and error-prone. To address
this challenge, prior research proposed machine learning based solutions to
auto-label educational content with limited success. In this work, we
significantly improve prior research by (1) expanding the input types to
include KC descriptions, instructional video titles, and problem descriptions
(i.e., three types of prediction task), (2) doubling the granularity of the
prediction from 198 to 385 KC labels (i.e., more practical setting but much
harder multinomial classification problem), (3) improving the prediction
accuracies by 0.5-2.3% using Task-adaptive Pre-trained BERT, outperforming six
baselines, and (4) proposing a simple evaluation measure by which we can
recover 56-73% of mispredicted KC labels. All codes and data sets in the

Towards Teachable Autotelic Agents,"Autonomous discovery and direct instruction are two distinct sources of
learning in children but education sciences demonstrate that mixed approaches
such as assisted discovery or guided play result in improved skill acquisition.
In the field of Artificial Intelligence, these extremes respectively map to
autonomous agents learning from their own signals and interactive learning
agents fully taught by their teachers. In between should stand teachable
autotelic agents (TAA): agents that learn from both internal and teaching
signals to benefit from the higher efficiency of assisted discovery. Designing
such agents will enable real-world non-expert users to orient the learning
trajectories of agents towards their expectations. More fundamentally, this may
also be a key step to build agents with human-level intelligence. This paper
presents a roadmap towards the design of teachable autonomous agents. Building
on developmental psychology and education sciences, we start by identifying key
features enabling assisted discovery processes in child-tutor interactions.
This leads to the production of a checklist of features that future TAA will
need to demonstrate. The checklist allows us to precisely pinpoint the various
limitations of current reinforcement learning agents and to identify the
promising first steps towards TAA. It also shows the way forward by
highlighting key research directions towards the design or autonomous agents
that can be taught by ordinary people via natural pedagogy.",2021-05-25,2021,2021-05,education

"Teaching Machine Learning in K-12 Computing Education: Potential and
  Pitfalls","Over the past decades, numerous practical applications of machine learning
techniques have shown the potential of data-driven approaches in a large number
of computing fields. Machine learning is increasingly included in computing
curricula in higher education, and a quickly growing number of initiatives are
expanding it in K-12 computing education, too. As machine learning enters K-12
computing education, understanding how intuition and agency in the context of
such systems is developed becomes a key research area. But as schools and
teachers are already struggling with integrating traditional computational
thinking and traditional artificial intelligence into school curricula,
understanding the challenges behind teaching machine learning in K-12 is an
even more daunting challenge for computing education research. Despite the
central position of machine learning in the field of modern computing, the

systems. This is especially true of the K-12 curriculum space. This article
charts the emerging trajectories in educational practice, theory, and
technology related to teaching machine learning in K-12 education. The article
situates the existing work in the context of computing education in general,
and describes some differences that K-12 computing educators should take into
account when facing this challenge. The article focuses on key aspects of the
paradigm shift that will be required in order to successfully integrate machine

Towards Fairness Certification in Artificial Intelligence,"Thanks to the great progress of machine learning in the last years, several
Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have been increasingly moving from the
controlled research laboratory settings to our everyday life. AI is clearly
supportive in many decision-making scenarios, but when it comes to sensitive
areas such as health care, hiring policies, education, banking or justice, with
major impact on individuals and society, it becomes crucial to establish
guidelines on how to design, develop, deploy and monitor this technology.
Indeed the decision rules elaborated by machine learning models are data-driven
and there are multiple ways in which discriminatory biases can seep into data.
Algorithms trained on those data incur the risk of amplifying prejudices and
societal stereotypes by over associating protected attributes such as gender,
ethnicity or disabilities with the prediction task. Starting from the extensive
experience of the National Metrology Institute on measurement standards and
certification roadmaps, and of Politecnico di Torino on machine learning as
well as methods for domain bias evaluation and mastering, we propose a first
joint effort to define the operational steps needed for AI fairness
certification. Specifically we will overview the criteria that should be met by

question generation as a controllable sequence generation task. We first show
how to fine-tune pre-trained language models for deep knowledge tracing

distinguish instances of different classes by enlarging the margin between
categories via contrastive loss. Furthermore, we design a strategy to fully
exploit the misclassified examples during the training stage. Extensive

"Automatic Task Requirements Writing Evaluation via Machine Reading
  Comprehension","Task requirements (TRs) writing is an important question type in Key English
Test and Preliminary English Test. A TR writing question may include multiple
requirements and a high-quality essay must respond to each requirement
thoroughly and accurately. However, the limited teacher resources prevent
students from getting detailed grading instantly. The majority of existing
automatic essay scoring systems focus on giving a holistic score but rarely

requirement question, but clearly marks where the essay answers the question.
Our framework consists of three modules: question normalization module, ELECTRA

"Accuracy analysis of Educational Data Mining using Feature Selection
  Algorithm","Gathering relevant information to predict student academic progress is a
tedious task. Due to the large amount of irrelevant data present in databases
which provides inaccurate results. Currently, it is not possible to accurately
measure and analyze student data because there are too many irrelevant
attributes and features in the data. With the help of Educational Data Mining
(EDM), the quality of information can be improved. This research demonstrates
how EDM helps to measure the accuracy of data using relevant attributes and
machine learning algorithms performed. With EDM, irrelevant features are
removed without changing the original data. The data set used in this study was
taken from Kaggle.com. The results compared on the basis of recall, precision
and f-measure to check the accuracy of the student data. The importance of this

Educational Resources (OER) are a crucial factor for greater educational
equity. In this paper, we describe the specific requirements for OER in ML and
DS and argue that it is especially important for these fields to make source

context-based alerts as well as recommendations to educators for course
planning. Furthermore, it incorporates model-agnostic explanations for bringing
explainability and interpretability in the process of decision making. This
paper demonstrates a use case scenario of our proposed tool using a real-world
dataset and presents the design of its architecture and user interface. This
demonstration focuses on the agglomerative clustering of students based on
their performance (i.e., incorrect responses and hints used) during an in-class

"Readying Medical Students for Medical AI: The Need to Embed AI Ethics
  Education","Medical students will almost inevitably encounter powerful medical AI systems
early in their careers. Yet, contemporary medical education does not adequately
equip students with the basic clinical proficiency in medical AI needed to use
these tools safely and effectively. Education reform is urgently needed, but
not easily implemented, largely due to an already jam-packed medical curricula.
In this article, we propose an education reform framework as an effective and
efficient solution, which we call the Embedded AI Ethics Education Framework.
Unlike other calls for education reform to accommodate AI teaching that are
more radical in scope, our framework is modest and incremental. It leverages
existing bioethics or medical ethics curricula to develop and deliver content
on the ethical issues associated with medical AI, especially the harms of
technology misuse, disuse, and abuse that affect the risk-benefit analyses at
the heart of healthcare. In doing so, the framework provides a simple tool for
going beyond the ""What?"" and the ""Why?"" of medical AI ethics education, to
answer the ""How?"", giving universities, course directors, and/or professors a
broad road-map for equipping their students with the necessary clinical
proficiency in medical AI.",2021-09-07,2021,2021-09,education
"It is AI's Turn to Ask Humans a Question: Question-Answer Pair
  Generation for Children's Story Books","Existing question answering (QA) techniques are created mainly to answer
questions asked by humans. But in educational applications, teachers often need

their narrative understanding capabilities. We design an automated
question-answer generation (QAG) system for this education scenario: given a
story book at the kindergarten to eighth-grade level as input, our system can
automatically generate QA pairs that are capable of testing a variety of
dimensions of a student's comprehension skills. Our proposed QAG model
architecture is demonstrated using a new expert-annotated FairytaleQA dataset,
which has 278 child-friendly storybooks with 10,580 QA pairs. Automatic and

"Some Critical and Ethical Perspectives on the Empirical Turn of AI
  Interpretability","We consider two fundamental and related issues currently faced by Artificial
Intelligence (AI) development: the lack of ethics and interpretability of AI
decisions. Can interpretable AI decisions help to address ethics in AI? Using a
randomized study, we experimentally show that the empirical and liberal turn of
the production of explanations tends to select AI explanations with a low
denunciatory power. Under certain conditions, interpretability tools are
therefore not means but, paradoxically, obstacles to the production of ethical
AI since they can give the illusion of being sensitive to ethical incidents. We
also show that the denunciatory power of AI explanations is highly dependent on
the context in which the explanation takes place, such as the gender or
education level of the person to whom the explication is intended for. AI
ethics tools are therefore sometimes too flexible and self-regulation through
the liberal production of explanations do not seem to be enough to address
ethical issues. We then propose two scenarios for the future development of
ethical AI: more external regulation or more liberalization of AI explanations.
These two opposite paths will play a major role on the future development of
ethical AI.",2021-09-20,2021,2021-09,education

"Explainable Student Performance Prediction With Personalized Attention
  for Explaining Why A Student Fails","As student failure rates continue to increase in higher education, predicting
student performance in the following semester has become a significant demand.
Personalized student performance prediction helps educators gain a
comprehensive view of student status and effectively intervene in advance.
However, existing works scarcely consider the explainability of student
performance prediction, which educators are most concerned about. In this
paper, we propose a novel Explainable Student performance prediction method
with Personalized Attention (ESPA) by utilizing relationships in student
profiles and prior knowledge of related courses. The designed Bidirectional
Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) architecture extracts the semantic information
in the paths with specific patterns. As for leveraging similar paths' internal
relations, a local and global-level attention mechanism is proposed to
distinguish the influence of different students or courses for making
predictions. Hence, valid reasoning on paths can be applied to predict the
performance of students. The ESPA consistently outperforms the other
state-of-the-art models for student performance prediction, and the results are
intuitively explainable. This work can help educators better understand the
different impacts of behavior on students' studies.",2021-10-15,2021,2021-10,education
Risks of AI Foundation Models in Education,"If the authors of a recent Stanford report (Bommasani et al., 2021) on the
opportunities and risks of ""foundation models"" are to be believed, these models
represent a paradigm shift for AI and for the domains in which they will
supposedly be used, including education. Although the name is new (and
contested (Field, 2021)), the term describes existing types of algorithmic
models that are ""trained on broad data at scale"" and ""fine-tuned"" (i.e.,
adapted) for particular downstream tasks, and is intended to encompass large
language models such as BERT or GPT-3 and computer vision models such as CLIP.
Such technologies have the potential for harm broadly speaking (e.g., Bender et
al., 2021), but their use in the educational domain is particularly fraught,
despite the potential benefits for learners claimed by the authors. In section
3.3 of the Stanford report, Malik et al. argue that achieving the goal of
providing education for all learners requires more efficient computational
approaches that can rapidly scale across educational domains and across
educational contexts, for which they argue foundation models are uniquely
well-suited. However, evidence suggests that not only are foundation models not
likely to achieve the stated benefits for learners, but their use may also
introduce new risks for harm.",2021-10-19,2021,2021-10,education

issues of those traditional AI technologies (e.g., deep learning) is that the
rapid progress in complexity and sophistication propelled and turned out to be
uninterpretable black boxes. On many occasions, it is very challenging to

Introducing Variational Autoencoders to High School Students,"Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models are a compelling way to
introduce K-12 students to AI education using an artistic medium, and hence
have drawn attention from K-12 AI educators. Previous Creative AI curricula

ground the interdisciplinary learning of AI, creative arts, and philosophy.
Thus, we designed a lesson to teach high school students about VAEs. We

"Words of Wisdom: Representational Harms in Learning From AI
  Communication","Many educational technologies use artificial intelligence (AI) that presents
generated or produced language to the learner. We contend that all language,
including all AI communication, encodes information about the identity of the

communication, however, the user may index identity information that does not
match the source. This can lead to representational harms if language
associated with one cultural group is presented as ""standard"" or ""neutral"", if
the language advantages one group over another, or if the language reinforces
negative stereotypes. In this work, we discuss a case study using a Visual
Question Generation (VQG) task involving gathering crowdsourced data from
targeted demographic groups. Generated questions will be presented to human
evaluators to understand how they index the identity behind the language,
whether and how they perceive any representational harms, and how they would

"Interpretable Knowledge Tracing: Simple and Efficient Student Modeling
  with Causal Relations","Intelligent Tutoring Systems have become critically important in future
learning environments. Knowledge Tracing (KT) is a crucial part of that system.
It is about inferring the skill mastery of students and predicting their
performance to adjust the curriculum accordingly. Deep Learning-based KT models
have shown significant predictive performance compared with traditional models.
However, it is difficult to extract psychologically meaningful explanations
from the tens of thousands of parameters in neural networks, that would relate
to cognitive theory. There are several ways to achieve high accuracy in student
performance prediction but diagnostic and prognostic reasoning is more critical
in learning sciences. Since KT problem has few observable features (problem ID
and student's correctness at each practice), we extract meaningful latent
features from students' response data by using machine learning and data mining
techniques. In this work, we present Interpretable Knowledge Tracing (IKT), a
simple model that relies on three meaningful latent features: individual skill
mastery, ability profile (learning transfer across skills), and problem
difficulty. IKT's prediction of future student performance is made using a
Tree-Augmented Naive Bayes Classifier (TAN), therefore its predictions are
easier to explain than deep learning-based student models. IKT also shows
better student performance prediction than deep learning-based student models
without requiring a huge amount of parameters. We conduct ablation studies on
each feature to examine their contribution to student performance prediction.
Thus, IKT has great potential for providing adaptive and personalized
instructions with causal reasoning in real-world educational systems.",2021-12-15,2021,2021-12,education
"ADAPQUEST: A Software for Web-Based Adaptive Questionnaires based on

of adaptive questionnaires based on Bayesian networks. Adaptiveness is intended
here as the dynamical choice of the question sequence on the basis of an
evolving model of the skill level of the test taker. Bayesian networks offer a
flexible and highly interpretable framework to describe such testing process,
especially when coping with multiple skills. ADAPQUEST embeds dedicated
elicitation strategies to simplify the elicitation of the questionnaire
parameters. An application of this tool for the diagnosis of mental disorders
is also discussed together with some implementation details.",2021-12-29,2021,2021-12,education
"Integrating Artificial Intelligence and Augmented Reality in Robotic
  Surgery: An Initial dVRK Study Using a Surgical Education Scenario","Robot-assisted surgery has become progressively more and more popular due to
its clinical advantages. In the meanwhile, the artificial intelligence and
augmented reality in robotic surgery are developing rapidly and receive lots of
attention. However, current methods have not discussed the coherent integration
of AI and AR in robotic surgery. In this paper, we develop a novel system by
seamlessly merging artificial intelligence module and augmented reality
visualization to automatically generate the surgical guidance for robotic
surgery education. Specifically, we first leverage reinforcement leaning to
learn from expert demonstration and then generate 3D guidance trajectory,
providing prior context information of the surgical procedure. Along with other
information such as text hint, the 3D trajectory is then overlaid in the stereo
view of dVRK, where the user can perceive the 3D guidance and learn the
procedure. The proposed system is evaluated through a preliminary experiment on
surgical education task peg-transfer, which proves its feasibility and
potential as the next generation of robot-assisted surgery education solution.",2022-01-02,2022,2022-01,education
Automated Theorem Proving in the Classroom,"We report on several scenarios of using automated theorem proving software in
university education. In particular, we focus on using the Theorema system in a
software-enhanced logic-course for students in computer science or artificial
intelligence. The purpose of using logic-software in our teaching is not to
teach students the proper use of a particular piece of software. In contrast,
we try to employ certain software in order to spark students' motivation and to
support their understanding of logic principles they are supposed to understand
after having passed the course. In a sense, we try to let the software act as a
logic-tutor, the software is not an additional subject we teach.",2022-01-03,2022,2022-01,education
"Deep Reinforcement Learning, a textbook","Deep reinforcement learning has gathered much attention recently. Impressive
results were achieved in activities as diverse as autonomous driving, game
playing, molecular recombination, and robotics. In all these fields, computer
programs have taught themselves to solve difficult problems. They have learned
to fly model helicopters and perform aerobatic manoeuvers such as loops and
rolls. In some applications they have even become better than the best humans,
such as in Atari, Go, poker and StarCraft. The way in which deep reinforcement
learning explores complex environments reminds us of how children learn, by
playfully trying out things, getting feedback, and trying again. The computer
seems to truly possess aspects of human learning; this goes to the heart of the
dream of artificial intelligence. The successes in research have not gone
unnoticed by educators, and universities have started to offer courses on the
subject. The aim of this book is to provide a comprehensive overview of the
field of deep reinforcement learning. The book is written for graduate students
of artificial intelligence, and for researchers and practitioners who wish to
better understand deep reinforcement learning methods and their challenges. We
assume an undergraduate-level of understanding of computer science and
artificial intelligence; the programming language of this book is Python. We
describe the foundations, the algorithms and the applications of deep
reinforcement learning. We cover the established model-free and model-based
methods that form the basis of the field. Developments go quickly, and we also
cover advanced topics: deep multi-agent reinforcement learning, deep
hierarchical reinforcement learning, and deep meta learning.",2022-01-04,2022,2022-01,education
"Challenges of Artificial Intelligence -- From Machine Learning and
  Computer Vision to Emotional Intelligence","Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a part of everyday conversation and
our lives. It is considered as the new electricity that is revolutionizing the
world. AI is heavily invested in both industry and academy. However, there is
also a lot of hype in the current AI debate. AI based on so-called deep
learning has achieved impressive results in many problems, but its limits are
already visible. AI has been under research since the 1940s, and the industry
has seen many ups and downs due to over-expectations and related
disappointments that have followed.
  The purpose of this book is to give a realistic picture of AI, its history,
its potential and limitations. We believe that AI is a helper, not a ruler of
humans. We begin by describing what AI is and how it has evolved over the
decades. After fundamentals, we explain the importance of massive data for the
current mainstream of artificial intelligence. The most common representations
for AI, methods, and machine learning are covered. In addition, the main
application areas are introduced. Computer vision has been central to the
development of AI. The book provides a general introduction to computer vision,
and includes an exposure to the results and applications of our own research.
Emotions are central to human intelligence, but little use has been made in AI.
We present the basics of emotional intelligence and our own research on the
topic. We discuss super-intelligence that transcends human understanding,
explaining why such achievement seems impossible on the basis of present
knowledge,and how AI could be improved. Finally, a summary is made of the
current state of AI and what to do in the future. In the appendix, we look at
the development of AI education, especially from the perspective of contents at
our own university.",2022-01-05,2022,2022-01,education
"A Transfer Learning Pipeline for Educational Resource Discovery with
  Application in Leading Paragraph Generation","Effective human learning depends on a wide selection of educational materials
that align with the learner's current understanding of the topic. While the
Internet has revolutionized human learning or education, a substantial resource
accessibility barrier still exists. Namely, the excess of online information
can make it challenging to navigate and discover high-quality learning
materials. In this paper, we propose the educational resource discovery (ERD)
pipeline that automates web resource discovery for novel domains. The pipeline
consists of three main steps: data collection, feature extraction, and resource
classification. We start with a known source domain and conduct resource
discovery on two unseen target domains via transfer learning. We first collect
frequent queries from a set of seed documents and search on the web to obtain
candidate resources, such as lecture slides and introductory blog posts. Then
we introduce a novel pretrained information retrieval deep neural network
model, query-document masked language modeling (QD-MLM), to extract deep
features of these candidate resources. We apply a tree-based classifier to
decide whether the candidate is a positive learning resource. The pipeline
achieves F1 scores of 0.94 and 0.82 when evaluated on two similar but novel
target domains. Finally, we demonstrate how this pipeline can benefit an
application: leading paragraph generation for surveys. This is the first study
that considers various web resources for survey generation, to the best of our
knowledge. We also release a corpus of 39,728 manually labeled web resources
and 659 queries from NLP, Computer Vision (CV), and Statistics (STATS).",2022-01-07,2022,2022-01,education
"A conceptual framework of Intelligent Management Control System for
  Higher Education","The utilization of management control systems in university management poses
a considerable challenge because university's strategic goals are not identical
to those applied in profit-oriented management. A university's management

different groups of stakeholders. The specificity of the university operation
assumes conducting long-term scientific research and educational programmes.
Therefore, the controlling approach to university management should considerat
long-term performance measurement as well as management in key areas such as
research, provision of education to students, and interaction with the tertiary

Revelation of Task Difficulty in AI-aided Education,"When a student is asked to perform a given task, her subjective estimate of
the difficulty of that task has a strong influence on her performance. There
exists a rich literature on the impact of perceived task difficulty on
performance and motivation. Yet, there is another topic that is closely related
to the subject of the influence of perceived task difficulty that did not
receive any attention in previous research - the influence of revealing the
true difficulty of a task to the student. This paper investigates the impact of
revealing the task difficulty on the student's performance, motivation,
self-efficacy and subjective task value via an experiment in which workers are
asked to solve matchstick riddles. Furthermore, we discuss how the experiment
results might be relevant for AI-aided education. Specifically, we elaborate on
the question of how a student's learning experience might be improved by
supporting her with two types of AI systems: an AI system that predicts task
difficulty and an AI system that determines when task difficulty should be
revealed and when not.",2022-01-12,2022,2022-01,education

Fooling MOSS Detection with Pretrained Language Models,"As artificial intelligence (AI) technologies become increasingly powerful and
prominent in society, their misuse is a growing concern. In educational
settings, AI technologies could be used by students to cheat on assignments and
exams. In this paper we explore whether transformers can be used to solve
introductory level programming assignments while bypassing commonly used AI
tools to detect similarities between pieces of software. We find that a student
using GPT-J [Wang and Komatsuzaki, 2021] can complete introductory level
programming assignments without triggering suspicion from MOSS [Aiken, 2000], a
widely used software similarity and plagiarism detection tool. This holds
despite the fact that GPT-J was not trained on the problems in question and is
not provided with any examples to work from. We further find that the code
written by GPT-J is diverse in structure, lacking any particular tells that
future plagiarism detection techniques may use to try to identify
algorithmically generated code. We conclude with a discussion of the ethical
and educational implications of large language models and directions for future
research.",2022-01-19,2022,2022-01,education

Surf or sleep? Understanding the influence of bedtime patterns on campus,"Poor sleep habits may cause serious problems of mind and body, and it is a
commonly observed issue for college students due to study workload as well as
peer and social influence. Understanding its impact and identifying students
with poor sleep habits matters a lot in educational management. Most of the
current research is either based on self-reports and questionnaires, suffering
from a small sample size and social desirability bias, or the methods used are
not suitable for the education system. In this paper, we develop a general
data-driven method for identifying students' sleep patterns according to their
Internet access pattern stored in the education management system and explore
its influence from various aspects. First, we design a Possion-based
probabilistic mixture model to cluster students according to the distribution
of bedtime and identify students who are used to staying up late. Second, we
profile students from five aspects (including eight dimensions) based on
campus-behavior data and build Bayesian networks to explore the relationship
between behavioral characteristics and sleeping habits. Finally, we test the

"Improving Students' Academic Performance with AI and Semantic
  Technologies","Artificial intelligence and semantic technologies are evolving and have been
applied in various research areas, including the education domain. Higher
Education institutions strive to improve students' academic performance. Early
intervention to at-risk students and a reasonable curriculum is vital for
students' success. Prior research opted for deploying traditional machine
learning models to predict students' performance. In terms of curriculum
semantic analysis, after conducting a comprehensive systematic review regarding
the use of semantic technologies in the Computer Science curriculum, a major
finding of the study is that technologies used to measure similarity have
limitations in terms of accuracy and ambiguity in the representation of
concepts, courses, etc. To fill these gaps, in this study, three
implementations were developed, that is, to predict students' performance using
marks from the previous semester, to model a course representation in a
semantic way and compute the similarity, and to identify the prerequisite
between two similar courses. Regarding performance prediction, we used the
combination of Genetic Algorithm and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) on a dataset
from a Brazilian university containing 248730 records. As for similarity
measurement, we deployed BERT to encode the sentences and used cosine
similarity to obtain the distance between courses. With respect to prerequisite
identification, TextRazor was applied to extract concepts from course
description, followed by employing SemRefD to measure the degree of
prerequisite between two concepts. The outcomes of this study can be summarized
as: (i) a breakthrough result improves Manrique's work by 2.5% in terms of
accuracy in dropout prediction; (ii) uncover the similarity between courses

simulate how different agents would respond to a student, and compare these
counterpart responses in terms of three abilities: speak like a teacher,
understand a student, help a student. Our method builds on the reliability of
comparative judgments in education and uses a probabilistic model and Bayesian
sampling to infer estimates of pedagogical ability. We find that, even though
conversational agents (Blender in particular) perform well on conversational
uptake, they are quantifiably worse than real teachers on several pedagogical
dimensions, especially with regard to helpfulness (Blender: {\Delta} ability =
-0.75; GPT-3: {\Delta} ability = -0.93).",2022-05-16,2022,2022-05,education
"A Deep Learning Approach for Automatic Detection of Qualitative Features
  of Lecturing","Artificial Intelligence in higher education opens new possibilities for
improving the lecturing process, such as enriching didactic materials, helping
in assessing students' works or even providing directions to the teachers on
how to enhance the lectures. We follow this research path, and in this work, we
explore how an academic lecture can be assessed automatically by quantitative
features. First, we prepare a set of qualitative features based on teaching
practices and then annotate the dataset of academic lecture videos collected
for this purpose. We then show how these features could be detected
automatically using machine learning and computer vision techniques. Our
results show the potential usefulness of our work.",2022-05-30,2022,2022-05,education
"Fair Classification via Transformer Neural Networks: Case Study of an
  Educational Domain","Educational technologies nowadays increasingly use data and Machine Learning
(ML) models. This gives the students, instructors, and administrators support
and insights for the optimum policy. However, it is well acknowledged that ML
models are subject to bias, which raises concerns about the fairness, bias, and
discrimination of using these automated ML algorithms in education and its
unintended and unforeseen negative consequences. The contribution of bias
during the decision-making comes from datasets used for training ML models and
the model architecture. This paper presents a preliminary investigation of the
fairness of transformer neural networks on the two tabular datasets: Law School
and Student-Mathematics. In contrast to classical ML models, the
transformer-based models transform these tabular datasets into a richer
representation while solving the classification task. We use different fairness
metrics for evaluation and check the trade-off between fairness and accuracy of
the transformer-based models over the tabular datasets. Empirically, our
approach shows impressive results regarding the trade-off between fairness and
performance on the Law School dataset.",2022-06-03,2022,2022-06,education
ArgRewrite V.2: an Annotated Argumentative Revisions Corpus,"Analyzing how humans revise their writings is an interesting research
question, not only from an educational perspective but also in terms of
artificial intelligence. Better understanding of this process could facilitate
many NLP applications, from intelligent tutoring systems to supportive and
collaborative writing environments. Developing these applications, however,
requires revision corpora, which are not widely available. In this work, we
present ArgRewrite V.2, a corpus of annotated argumentative revisions,
collected from two cycles of revisions to argumentative essays about
self-driving cars. Annotations are provided at different levels of purpose
granularity (coarse and fine) and scope (sentential and subsentential). In
addition, the corpus includes the revision goal given to each writer, essay
scores, annotation verification, pre- and post-study surveys collected from
participants as meta-data. The variety of revision unit scope and purpose
granularity levels in ArgRewrite, along with the inclusion of new types of
meta-data, can make it a useful resource for research and applications that
involve revision analysis. We demonstrate some potential applications of
ArgRewrite V.2 in the development of automatic revision purpose predictors, as
a training source and benchmark.",2022-06-03,2022,2022-06,education
"Towards Systems Education for Artificial Intelligence: A Course Practice

bridge the gap between AI and computing systems, we are trying to explore how
to conduct AI education from the perspective of computing systems. In this
paper, a course practice in intelligent computing architectures are provided to
demonstrate the system education in AI era. The motivation for this course
practice is first introduced as well as the learning orientations. The main
goal of this course aims to teach students for designing AI accelerators on

"Can Population-based Engagement Improve Personalisation? A Novel Dataset
  and Experiments","This work explores how population-based engagement prediction can address
cold-start at scale in large learning resource collections. The paper
introduces i) VLE, a novel dataset that consists of content and video based
features extracted from publicly available scientific video lectures coupled
with implicit and explicit signals related to learner engagement, ii) two
standard tasks related to predicting and ranking context-agnostic engagement in
video lectures with preliminary baselines and iii) a set of experiments that
validate the usefulness of the proposed dataset. Our experimental results
indicate that the newly proposed VLE dataset leads to building context-agnostic
engagement prediction models that are significantly performant than ones based
on previous datasets, mainly attributing to the increase of training examples.
VLE dataset's suitability in building models towards Computer Science/
Artificial Intelligence education focused on e-learning/ MOOC use-cases is also
evidenced. Further experiments in combining the built model with a
personalising algorithm show promising improvements in addressing the
cold-start problem encountered in educational recommenders. This is the largest

"Human-AI communication for human-human communication: Applying
  interpretable unsupervised anomaly detection to executive coaching","In this paper, we discuss the potential of applying unsupervised anomaly
detection in constructing AI-based interactive systems that deal with highly
contextual situations, i.e., human-human communication, in collaboration with
domain experts. We reached this approach of utilizing unsupervised anomaly
detection through our experience of developing a computational support tool for
executive coaching, which taught us the importance of providing interpretable
results so that expert coaches can take both the results and contexts into
account. The key idea behind this approach is to leave room for expert coaches
to unleash their open-ended interpretations, rather than simplifying the nature
of social interactions to well-defined problems that are tractable by
conventional supervised algorithms. In addition, we found that this approach
can be extended to nurturing novice coaches; by prompting them to interpret the
results from the system, it can provide the coaches with educational
opportunities. Although the applicability of this approach should be validated
in other domains, we believe that the idea of leveraging unsupervised anomaly
detection to construct AI-based interactive systems would shed light on another
direction of human-AI communication.",2022-06-22,2022,2022-06,education
"Experts' View on Challenges and Needs for Fairness in Artificial
  Intelligence for Education","In recent years, there has been a stimulating discussion on how artificial
intelligence (AI) can support the science and engineering of intelligent
educational applications. Many studies in the field are proposing actionable
data mining pipelines and machine-learning models driven by learning-related
data. The potential of these pipelines and models to amplify unfairness for
certain categories of students is however receiving increasing attention. If AI
applications are to have a positive impact on education, it is crucial that
their design considers fairness at every step. Through anonymous surveys and
interviews with experts (researchers and practitioners) who have published
their research at top-tier educational conferences in the last year, we
conducted the first expert-driven systematic investigation on the challenges
and needs for addressing fairness throughout the development of educational
systems based on AI. We identified common and diverging views about the
challenges and the needs faced by educational technologies experts in practice,
that lead the community to have a clear understanding on the main questions

Implementing a Chatbot Solution for Learning Management System,"Innovation is a key component in trying new solutions for the students to
learn efficiently and in ways that correspond to their own experience, where
chatbots are one of these new solutions. One of the main problem that chatbots
face today is to mimic human language, where they try to find the best answer
to an input, which is not how a human conversation usually works, rather taking
into account the previous messages and building onto them. Extreme programming
methodology was chosen to use integrate ChatterBot, Pyside2, web scraping and
Tampermonkey into Blackboard as a test case. Problems occurred with the bot and
more training was needed for the bot to work perfectly, but the integration and

"Kwame for Science: An AI Teaching Assistant Based on Sentence-BERT for
  Science Education in West Africa","Africa has a high student-to-teacher ratio which limits students' access to
teachers. Consequently, students struggle to get answers to their questions. In
this work, we extended Kwame, our previous AI teaching assistant, adapted it
for science education, and deployed it as a web app. Kwame for Science answers
questions of students based on the Integrated Science subject of the West
African Senior Secondary Certificate Examination (WASSCE). Kwame for Science is
a Sentence-BERT-based question-answering web app that displays 3 paragraphs as
answers along with a confidence score in response to science questions.
Additionally, it displays the top 5 related past exam questions and their

"Complementary artificial intelligence designed to augment human
  discovery","Neither artificial intelligence designed to play Turing's imitation game, nor
augmented intelligence built to maximize the human manipulation of information
are tuned to accelerate innovation and improve humanity's collective advance
against its greatest challenges. We reconceptualize and pilot beneficial AI to
radically augment human understanding by complementing rather than competing
with human cognitive capacity. Our approach to complementary intelligence
builds on insights underlying the wisdom of crowds, which hinges on the
independence and diversity of crowd members' information and approach. By
programmatically incorporating information on the evolving distribution of
scientific expertise from research papers, our approach follows the
distribution of content in the literature while avoiding the scientific crowd
and the hypotheses cognitively available to it. We use this approach to
generate valuable predictions for what materials possess valuable
energy-related properties (e.g., thermoelectricity), and what compounds possess
valuable medical properties (e.g., asthma) that complement the human scientific
crowd. We demonstrate that our complementary predictions, if identified by
human scientists and inventors at all, are only discovered years further into
the future. When we evaluate the promise of our predictions with
first-principles equations, we demonstrate that increased complementarity of
our predictions does not decrease and in some cases increases the probability
that the predictions possess the targeted properties. In summary, by tuning AI
to avoid the crowd, we can generate hypotheses unlikely to be imagined or
pursued until the distant future and promise to punctuate scientific advance.
By identifying and correcting for collective human bias, these models also
suggest opportunities to improve human prediction by reformulating science
education for discovery.",2022-07-02,2022,2022-07,education
Privacy-Preserving Synthetic Educational Data Generation,"Institutions collect massive learning traces but they may not disclose it for

Reflections on the Evolution of Computer Science Education,"Computer Science education has been evolving over the years to reflect
applied realities. Until about a decade ago, theory of computation, algorithm
design and system software dominated the curricula. Most courses were
considered core and were hence mandatory; the programme structure did not allow
much of a choice or variety. This column analyses why this changed Circa 2010
when elective subjects across scores of topics become part of mainstream
education to reflect the on-going lateral acceleration of Computer Science.
Fundamental discoveries in artificial intelligence, machine learning,
virtualization and cloud computing are several decades old. Many core theories
in data science are centuries old. Yet their leverage exploded only after Circa
2010, when the stage got set for people-centric problem solving in massive
scale. This was due in part to the rush of innovative real-world applications
that reached the common man through the ubiquitous smart phone. AI/ML modules
arrived in popular programming languages; they could be used to build and train
models on powerful - yet affordable - compute on public clouds reachable
through high-speed Internet connectivity. Academia responded by adapting
Computer Science curricula to align it with the changing technology landscape.
The goal of this experiential piece is to trigger a lively discussion on the
past and future of Computer Science education.",2022-07-09,2022,2022-07,education

Using Adaptive Experiments to Rapidly Help Students,"Adaptive experiments can increase the chance that current students obtain
better outcomes from a field experiment of an instructional intervention. In
such experiments, the probability of assigning students to conditions changes
while more data is being collected, so students can be assigned to
interventions that are likely to perform better. Digital educational
environments lower the barrier to conducting such adaptive experiments, but
they are rarely applied in education. One reason might be that researchers have
access to few real-world case studies that illustrate the advantages and
disadvantages of these experiments in a specific context. We evaluate the
effect of homework email reminders in students by conducting an adaptive
experiment using the Thompson Sampling algorithm and compare it to a
traditional uniform random experiment. We present this as a case study on how
to conduct such experiments, and we raise a range of open questions about the

"Multimodal Lecture Presentations Dataset: Understanding Multimodality in
  Educational Slides","Lecture slide presentations, a sequence of pages that contain text and
figures accompanied by speech, are constructed and presented carefully in order
to optimally transfer knowledge to students. Previous studies in multimedia and
psychology attribute the effectiveness of lecture presentations to their
multimodal nature. As a step toward developing AI to aid in student learning as
intelligent teacher assistants, we introduce the Multimodal Lecture
Presentations dataset as a large-scale benchmark testing the capabilities of
machine learning models in multimodal understanding of educational content. Our
dataset contains aligned slides and spoken language, for 180+ hours of video
and 9000+ slides, with 10 lecturers from various subjects (e.g., computer
science, dentistry, biology). We introduce two research tasks which are
designed as stepping stones towards AI agents that can explain (automatically
captioning a lecture presentation) and illustrate (synthesizing visual figures
to accompany spoken explanations) educational content. We provide manual
annotations to help implement these two research tasks and evaluate
state-of-the-art models on them. Comparing baselines and human student
performances, we find that current models struggle in (1) weak crossmodal
alignment between slides and spoken text, (2) learning novel visual mediums,
(3) technical language, and (4) long-range sequences. Towards addressing this
issue, we also introduce PolyViLT, a multimodal transformer trained with a
multi-instance learning loss that is more effective than current approaches. We
conclude by shedding light on the challenges and opportunities in multimodal

"Why Are Some Online Educational Programs Successful? Student Cognition

programs for online education have emerged including an online graduate program
in computer science at a major public university in USA. This program is
considered a success with over 9000 students now enrolled in the program. We
adopt the perspective of cognitive science to answer the question why do only
some online educational courses succeed? We measure learner motivation and
self-regulation in one course in the program, specifically a course on
artificial intelligence (AI). Surveys of students indicate that students
self-reported assessments of self-efficacy, cognitive strategy use, and
intrinsic value of the course are not only fairly high, but also generally
increase over the course of learning. This data suggests that the online AI

"Lost in Translation: Reimagining the Machine Learning Life Cycle in
  Education","Machine learning (ML) techniques are increasingly prevalent in education,
from their use in predicting student dropout, to assisting in university

novel uses, there is a pressing need to investigate how ML techniques support
long-standing education principles and goals. In this work, we shed light on
this complex landscape drawing on qualitative insights from interviews with
education experts. These interviews comprise in-depth evaluations of ML for
education (ML4Ed) papers published in preeminent applied ML conferences over
the past decade. Our central research goal is to critically examine how the
stated or implied education and societal objectives of these papers are aligned
with the ML problems they tackle. That is, to what extent does the technical
problem formulation, objectives, approach, and interpretation of results align
with the education problem at hand. We find that a cross-disciplinary gap
exists and is particularly salient in two parts of the ML life cycle: the
formulation of an ML problem from education goals and the translation of
predictions to interventions. We use these insights to propose an extended ML
life cycle, which may also apply to the use of ML in other domains. Our work
joins a growing number of meta-analytical studies across education and ML
research, as well as critical analyses of the societal impact of ML.

Real-Time Automated Answer Scoring,"In recent years, the role of big data analytics has exponentially grown and

being made in this sphere in order to improve the quality of education being
provided to students and while many collaborations have been carried out
before, automated scoring of answers has been explored to a rather limited
extent. One of the biggest hurdles to choosing constructed-response assessments
over multiple-choice assessments is the effort and large cost that comes with
their evaluation and this is precisely the issue that this project aims to
solve. The aim is to accept raw-input from the student in the form of their
answer, preprocess the answer, and automatically score the answer. In addition,

"A Framework for Undergraduate Data Collection Strategies for Student
  Support Recommendation Systems in Higher Education","Understanding which student support strategies mitigate dropout and improve
student retention is an important part of modern higher educational research.
One of the largest challenges institutions of higher learning currently face is
the scalability of student support. Part of this is due to the shortage of
staff addressing the needs of students, and the subsequent referral pathways
associated to provide timeous student support strategies. This is further
complicated by the difficulty of these referrals, especially as students are
often faced with a combination of administrative, academic, social, and
socio-economic challenges. A possible solution to this problem can be a
combination of student outcome predictions and applying algorithmic recommender
systems within the context of higher education. While much effort and detail
has gone into the expansion of explaining algorithmic decision making in this
context, there is still a need to develop data collection strategies Therefore,
the purpose of this paper is to outline a data collection framework specific to
recommender systems within this context in order to reduce collection biases,
understand student characteristics, and find an ideal way to infer optimal
influences on the student journey. If confirmation biases, challenges in data
sparsity and the type of information to collect from students are not
addressed, it will have detrimental effects on attempts to assess and evaluate
the effects of these systems within higher education.",2022-10-16,2022,2022-10,education
EDUKG: a Heterogeneous Sustainable K-12 Educational Knowledge Graph,"Web and artificial intelligence technologies, especially semantic web and
knowledge graph (KG), have recently raised significant attention in educational
scenarios. Nevertheless, subject-specific KGs for K-12 education still lack
sufficiency and sustainability from knowledge and data perspectives. To tackle
these issues, we propose EDUKG, a heterogeneous sustainable K-12 Educational
Knowledge Graph. We first design an interdisciplinary and fine-grained ontology
for uniformly modeling knowledge and resource in K-12 education, where we
define 635 classes, 445 object properties, and 1314 datatype properties in
total. Guided by this ontology, we propose a flexible methodology for
interactively extracting factual knowledge from textbooks. Furthermore, we
establish a general mechanism based on our proposed generalized entity linking
system for EDUKG's sustainable maintenance, which can dynamically index
numerous heterogeneous resources and data with knowledge topics in EDUKG. We
further evaluate EDUKG to illustrate its sufficiency, richness, and
variability. We publish EDUKG with more than 252 million entities and 3.86
billion triplets. Our code and data repository is now available at

nano microcontroller actuates two servo motors that move the paper clips.
However, such mechanical configuration confers physical impairments to
movement. This creates the need for and allows experimenting with artificial

Reinforcement Learning in Education: A Multi-Armed Bandit Approach,"Advances in reinforcement learning research have demonstrated the ways in
which different agent-based models can learn how to optimally perform a task
within a given environment. Reinforcement leaning solves unsupervised problems
where agents move through a state-action-reward loop to maximize the overall
reward for the agent, which in turn optimizes the solving of a specific problem
in a given environment. However, these algorithms are designed based on our
understanding of actions that should be taken in a real-world environment to
solve a specific problem. One such problem is the ability to identify,
recommend and execute an action within a system where the users are the
subject, such as in education. In recent years, the use of blended learning
approaches integrating face-to-face learning with online learning in the
education context, has in-creased. Additionally, online platforms used for
education require the automation of certain functions such as the
identification, recommendation or execution of actions that can benefit the
user, in this sense, the student or learner. As promising as these scientific
advances are, there is still a need to conduct research in a variety of
different areas to ensure the successful deployment of these agents within
education systems. Therefore, the aim of this study was to contextualise and
simulate the cumulative reward within an environment for an intervention
recommendation problem in the education context.",2022-11-01,2022,2022-11,education

"Liability regimes in the age of AI: a use-case driven analysis of the
  burden of proof","New emerging technologies powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) have the
potential to disruptively transform our societies for the better. In
particular, data-driven learning approaches (i.e., Machine Learning (ML)) have
been a true revolution in the advancement of multiple technologies in various
application domains. But at the same time there is growing concern about
certain intrinsic characteristics of these methodologies that carry potential
risks to both safety and fundamental rights. Although there are mechanisms in
the adoption process to minimize these risks (e.g., safety regulations), these
do not exclude the possibility of harm occurring, and if this happens, victims
should be able to seek compensation. Liability regimes will therefore play a
key role in ensuring basic protection for victims using or interacting with
these systems. However, the same characteristics that make AI systems
inherently risky, such as lack of causality, opacity, unpredictability or their
self and continuous learning capabilities, may lead to considerable
difficulties when it comes to proving causation. This paper presents three case
studies, as well as the methodology to reach them, that illustrate these
difficulties. Specifically, we address the cases of cleaning robots, delivery
drones and robots in education. The outcome of the proposed analysis suggests
the need to revise liability regimes to alleviate the burden of proof on

Scratch projects, trained and evaluated on human expert creativity assessments
in an extensive user study. Our results show that opinions about creativity in
Scratch varied widely across experts. The automatic creativity assessment

However, given limited resources, not all policies can or should be equally
prioritized. We define and review nine suggested policies for furthering
responsible AI, rank each policy on potential use and impact, and recommend
prioritization relative to each institution type. We find that pre-deployment
audits and assessments and post-deployment accountability are likely to have
the highest impact but also the highest barriers to adoption. We recommend that
U.S. government agencies and companies highly prioritize development of
pre-deployment audits and assessments, while the U.S. national legislature

government agencies and professional societies should highly prioritize
policies that support responsible AI research and that states should highly
prioritize support of responsible AI education. We propose that companies can
highly prioritize involving community stakeholders in development efforts and
supporting diversity in AI development. We advise lower levels of

essential for a better society. As the foundational axiom of social mechanisms,
fairness consists of multiple facets. Although the machine learning (ML)

another facet -- monotonicity. Based on domain expertise, monotonicity plays a
vital role in numerous fairness-related areas, where violations could misguide

"Matching Exemplar as Next Sentence Prediction (MeNSP): Zero-shot Prompt
  Learning for Automatic Scoring in Science Education","Developing models to automatically score students' written responses to
science problems is critical for science education. However, collecting and
labeling sufficient student responses for training models is time and
cost-consuming. Recent studies suggest that pre-trained language models can be
adapted to downstream tasks without fine-tuning with prompts. However, no
research has employed such a prompt approach in science education. As student
responses are presented with natural language, aligning the scoring procedure
as the next sentence prediction task using prompts can skip the costly
fine-tuning stage. In this study, we developed a zero-shot approach to
automatically score student responses via Matching Exemplars as Next Sentence
Prediction (MeNSP). This approach employs no training samples. We first apply
MeNSP in scoring three assessment tasks of scientific argumentation and found
machine-human scoring agreements, Cohen's Kappa ranges from 0.30 to 0.57, and
F1 score ranges from 0.54 to 0.81. To improve the performance, we extend our
research to the few-shots setting, either randomly selecting labeled student
responses or manually constructing responses to fine-tune the models. We find
that one task's performance is improved with more samples, Cohen's Kappa from
0.30 to 0.38, and F1 score from 0.54 to 0.59; for the two others, scoring
performance is not improved. We also find that randomly selected few-shots
perform better than the human expert-crafted approach. This study suggests that
MeNSP can yield referable automatic scoring for student responses while
significantly reducing the cost of model training. This method can benefit
low-stakes classroom assessment practices in science education. Future research
should further explore the applicability of the MeNSP in different types of
assessment tasks in science education and improve the model performance.",2023-01-20,2023,2023-01,education

Investigating Labeler Bias in Face Annotation for Machine Learning,"In a world increasingly reliant on artificial intelligence, it is more
important than ever to consider the ethical implications of artificial
intelligence on humanity. One key under-explored challenge is labeler bias,
which can create inherently biased datasets for training and subsequently lead
to inaccurate or unfair decisions in healthcare, employment, education, and law
enforcement. Hence, we conducted a study to investigate and measure the
existence of labeler bias using images of people from different ethnicities and
sexes in a labeling task. Our results show that participants possess
stereotypes that influence their decision-making process and that labeler
demographics impact assigned labels. We also discuss how labeler bias
influences datasets and, subsequently, the models trained on them. Overall, a
high degree of transparency must be maintained throughout the entire artificial
intelligence training process to identify and correct biases in the data as
early as possible.",2023-01-24,2023,2023-01,education
Smart tutor to provide feedback in programming courses,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming more and more popular as time
passes, allowing to perform tasks that were difficult to do in the past. From
predictions to customization, AI is being used in many areas, not being
educational environments outside this situation. AI is being used in
educational settings to customize contents or to provide personalized feedback
to the students, among others. In this scenario, AI in programming teaching is
something that still has to be explored, since in this area we usually find
assessment tools that allow grading the students work, but we can not find many
tools aimed towards providing feedback to the students in the process of
creating their program. In this work we present an AI based intelligent tutor
that answers students programming questions. The tool has been tested by
university students at the URJC along a whole course. Even if the tool is still
in its preliminary phase, it helped the students with their questions,
providing accurate answers and examples. The students were able to use the
intelligent tutor easily and they thought that it could be a useful tool to use
in other courses.",2023-01-24,2023,2023-01,education
"Generating High-Precision Feedback for Programming Syntax Errors using
  Large Language Models","Large language models (LLMs), such as Codex, hold great promise in enhancing
programming education by automatically generating feedback for students. We
investigate using LLMs to generate feedback for fixing syntax errors in Python
programs, a key scenario in introductory programming. More concretely, given a
student's buggy program, our goal is to generate feedback comprising a fixed
program along with a natural language explanation describing the errors/fixes,
inspired by how a human tutor would give feedback. While using LLMs is
promising, the critical challenge is to ensure high precision in the generated
feedback, which is imperative before deploying such technology in classrooms.
The main research question we study is: Can we develop LLMs-based feedback
generation techniques with a tunable precision parameter, giving educators
quality control over the feedback that students receive? To this end, we
introduce PyFiXV, our technique to generate high-precision feedback powered by
Codex. The key idea behind PyFiXV is to use a novel run-time validation
mechanism to decide whether the generated feedback is suitable for sharing with
the student; notably, this validation mechanism also provides a precision knob
to educators. We perform an extensive evaluation using two real-world datasets
of Python programs with syntax errors and show the efficacy of PyFiXV in
generating high-precision feedback.",2023-01-24,2023,2023-01,education
"Context Matters: A Strategy to Pre-train Language Model for Science
  Education","This study aims at improving the performance of scoring student responses in
science education automatically. BERT-based language models have shown
significant superiority over traditional NLP models in various language-related
tasks. However, science writing of students, including argumentation and
explanation, is domain-specific. In addition, the language used by students is
different from the language in journals and Wikipedia, which are training
sources of BERT and its existing variants. All these suggest that a
domain-specific model pre-trained using science education data may improve
model performance. However, the ideal type of data to contextualize pre-trained
language model and improve the performance in automatically scoring student
written responses remains unclear. Therefore, we employ different data in this
study to contextualize both BERT and SciBERT models and compare their
performance on automatic scoring of assessment tasks for scientific
argumentation. We use three datasets to pre-train the model: 1) journal
articles in science education, 2) a large dataset of students' written
responses (sample size over 50,000), and 3) a small dataset of students'
written responses of scientific argumentation tasks. Our experimental results
show that in-domain training corpora constructed from science questions and
responses improve language model performance on a wide variety of downstream
tasks. Our study confirms the effectiveness of continual pre-training on
domain-specific data in the education domain and demonstrates a generalizable
strategy for automating science education tasks with high accuracy. We plan to
release our data and SciEdBERT models for public use and community engagement.",2023-01-27,2023,2023-01,education

Will ChatGPT get you caught? Rethinking of Plagiarism Detection,"The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology and its impact on
education has been a topic of growing concern in recent years. The new
generation AI systems such as chatbots have become more accessible on the
Internet and stronger in terms of capabilities. The use of chatbots,
particularly ChatGPT, for generating academic essays at schools and colleges
has sparked fears among scholars. This study aims to explore the originality of
contents produced by one of the most popular AI chatbots, ChatGPT. To this end,
two popular plagiarism detection tools were used to evaluate the originality of
50 essays generated by ChatGPT on various topics. Our results manifest that
ChatGPT has a great potential to generate sophisticated text outputs without
being well caught by the plagiarism check software. In other words, ChatGPT can
create content on many topics with high originality as if they were written by
someone. These findings align with the recent concerns about students using
chatbots for an easy shortcut to success with minimal or no effort. Moreover,
ChatGPT was asked to verify if the essays were generated by itself, as an
additional measure of plagiarism check, and it showed superior performance
compared to the traditional plagiarism-detection tools. The paper discusses the
need for institutions to consider appropriate measures to mitigate potential
plagiarism issues and advise on the ongoing debate surrounding the impact of AI

"Improving Interpretability of Deep Sequential Knowledge Tracing Models
  with Question-centric Cognitive Representations","Knowledge tracing (KT) is a crucial technique to predict students' future
performance by observing their historical learning processes. Due to the
powerful representation ability of deep neural networks, remarkable progress
has been made by using deep learning techniques to solve the KT problem. The
majority of existing approaches rely on the \emph{homogeneous question}
assumption that questions have equivalent contributions if they share the same
set of knowledge components. Unfortunately, this assumption is inaccurate in
real-world educational scenarios. Furthermore, it is very challenging to
interpret the prediction results from the existing deep learning based KT
models. Therefore, in this paper, we present QIKT, a question-centric
interpretable KT model to address the above challenges. The proposed QIKT
approach explicitly models students' knowledge state variations at a
fine-grained level with question-sensitive cognitive representations that are
jointly learned from a question-centric knowledge acquisition module and a
question-centric problem solving module. Meanwhile, the QIKT utilizes an item
response theory based prediction layer to generate interpretable prediction
results. The proposed QIKT model is evaluated on three public real-world
educational datasets. The results demonstrate that our approach is superior on
the KT prediction task, and it outperforms a wide range of deep learning based
KT models in terms of prediction accuracy with better model interpretability.

"Platform-Independent and Curriculum-Oriented Intelligent Assistant for
  Higher Education","Miscommunication and communication challenges between instructors and

Students often avoid or miss opportunities to ask questions during office hours
due to insecurities or scheduling conflicts. Moreover, students need to work at
their own pace to have the freedom and time for the self-contemplation needed
to build conceptual understanding and develop creative thinking skills. To
eliminate barriers to student engagement, academic institutions need to
redefine their fundamental approach to education by proposing flexible
educational pathways that recognize continuous learning. To this end, we
developed an AI-augmented intelligent educational assistance framework based on
a power language model (i.e., GPT-3) that automatically generates
course-specific intelligent assistants regardless of discipline or academic

"DKT-STDRL: Spatial and Temporal Representation Learning Enhanced Deep
  Knowledge Tracing for Learning Performance Prediction","Knowledge tracing (KT) serves as a primary part of intelligent education
systems. Most current KTs either rely on expert judgments or only exploit a
single network structure, which affects the full expression of learning
features. To adequately mine features of students' learning process, Deep
Knowledge Tracing Based on Spatial and Temporal Deep Representation Learning
for Learning Performance Prediction (DKT-STDRL) is proposed in this paper.
DKT-STDRL extracts spatial features from students' learning history sequence,
and then further extracts temporal features to extract deeper hidden
information. Specifically, firstly, the DKT-STDRL model uses CNN to extract the
spatial feature information of students' exercise sequences. Then, the spatial
features are connected with the original students' exercise features as joint
learning features. Then, the joint features are input into the BiLSTM part.
Finally, the BiLSTM part extracts the temporal features from the joint learning
features to obtain the prediction information of whether the students answer
correctly at the next time step. Experiments on the public education datasets

Finding Similar Exercises in Retrieval Manner,"When students make a mistake in an exercise, they can consolidate it by
``similar exercises'' which have the same concepts, purposes and methods.
Commonly, for a certain subject and study stage, the size of the exercise bank
is in the range of millions to even tens of millions, how to find similar
exercises for a given exercise becomes a crucial technical problem. Generally,
we can assign a variety of explicit labels to the exercise, and then query
through the labels, but the label annotation is time-consuming, laborious and
costly, with limited precision and granularity, so it is not feasible. In
practice, we define ``similar exercises'' as a retrieval process of finding a
set of similar exercises based on recall, ranking and re-rank procedures,
called the \textbf{FSE} problem (Finding similar exercises). Furthermore,
comprehensive representation of the semantic information of exercises was
obtained through representation learning. In addition to the reasonable
architecture, we also explore what kind of tasks are more conducive to the
learning of exercise semantic information from pre-training and supervised
learning. It is difficult to annotate similar exercises and the annotation
consistency among experts is low. Therefore this paper also provides solutions

and ethicality of these innovations. Such concerns may hinder future research
and the adoption of LLMs-based innovations in authentic educational contexts.
To address this, we conducted a systematic scoping review of 118 peer-reviewed
papers published since 2017 to pinpoint the current state of research on using
LLMs to automate and support educational tasks. The findings revealed 53 use
cases for LLMs in automating education tasks, categorised into nine main

thus perfectly aligning itself with ethics, the science of human flourishing.
Further, HCAI provides objectives, principles, procedures, and structures for
reliable, safe, and trustworthy AI which we apply to our ChatGPT assessments.
The main danger ChatGPT presents is the propensity to be used as a weapon of
mass deception (WMD) and an enabler of criminal activities involving deceit. We
review technical specifications to better comprehend its potentials and
limitations. We then suggest both technical (watermarking, styleme, detectors,
and fact-checkers) and non-technical measures (terms of use, transparency,

  learning videos","Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (AI) have captured
worldwide attention. Tools such as Dalle-2 and ChatGPT suggest that tasks
previously thought to be beyond the capabilities of AI may now augment the
productivity of creative media in various new ways, including through the
generation of synthetic video. This research paper explores the utility of
using AI-generated synthetic video to create viable educational content for
online educational settings. To date, there is limited research investigating
the real-world educational value of AI-generated synthetic media. To address
this gap, we examined the impact of using AI-generated synthetic video in an
online learning platform on both learners content acquisition and learning
experience. We took a mixed-method approach, randomly assigning adult learners
(n=83) into one of two micro-learning conditions, collecting pre- and
post-learning assessments, and surveying participants on their learning
experience. The control condition included a traditionally produced instructor
video, while the experimental condition included a synthetic video with a
realistic AI-generated character. The results show that learners in both
conditions demonstrated significant improvement from pre- to post-learning
(p<.001), with no significant differences in gains between the two conditions
(p=.80). In addition, no differences were observed in how learners perceived

"Does Informativeness Matter? Active Learning for Educational Dialogue
  Act Classification","Dialogue Acts (DAs) can be used to explain what expert tutors do and what
students know during the tutoring process. Most empirical studies adopt the
random sampling method to obtain sentence samples for manual annotation of DAs,
which are then used to train DA classifiers. However, these studies have paid
little attention to sample informativeness, which can reflect the information
quantity of the selected samples and inform the extent to which a classifier
can learn patterns. Notably, the informativeness level may vary among the
samples and the classifier might only need a small amount of low informative
samples to learn the patterns. Random sampling may overlook sample
informativeness, which consumes human labelling costs and contributes less to
training the classifiers. As an alternative, researchers suggest employing
statistical sampling methods of Active Learning (AL) to identify the
informative samples for training the classifiers. However, the use of AL
methods in educational DA classification tasks is under-explored. In this
paper, we examine the informativeness of annotated sentence samples. Then, the
study investigates how the AL methods can select informative samples to support
DA classifiers in the AL sampling process. The results reveal that most
annotated sentences present low informativeness in the training dataset and the
patterns of these sentences can be easily captured by the DA classifier. We
also demonstrate how AL methods can reduce the cost of manual annotation in the
AL sampling process.",2023-04-12,2023,2023-04,education
"How do physics students evaluate artificial intelligence responses on
  comprehension questions? A study on the perceived scientific accuracy and
  linguistic quality","This study aimed at evaluating how students perceive the linguistic quality
and scientific accuracy of ChatGPT responses to physics comprehension
questions. A total of 102 first- and second-year physics students were
confronted with three questions of progressing difficulty from introductory
mechanics (rolling motion, waves, and fluid dynamics). Each question was
presented with four different responses. All responses were attributed to
ChatGPT, but in reality one sample solution was created by the researchers. All
ChatGPT responses obtained in this study were wrong, imprecise, incomplete, or
misleading. We found little differences in the perceived linguistic quality
between ChatGPT responses and the sample solution. However, the students rated
the overall scientific accuracy of the responses significantly differently,
with the sample solution being rated best for the questions of low and medium
difficulty. The discrepancy between the sample solution and the ChatGPT
responses increased with the level of self-assessed knowledge of the question
content. For the question of highest difficulty (fluid dynamics) that was
unknown to most students, a ChatGPT response was rated just as good as the
sample solution. Thus, this study provides data on the students' perception of
ChatGPT responses and the factors influencing their perception. The results
highlight the need for careful evaluation of ChatGPT responses both by
instructors and students, particularly regarding scientific accuracy.

"Robust Educational Dialogue Act Classifiers with Low-Resource and
  Imbalanced Datasets","Dialogue acts (DAs) can represent conversational actions of tutors or
students that take place during tutoring dialogues. Automating the
identification of DAs in tutoring dialogues is significant to the design of
dialogue-based intelligent tutoring systems. Many prior studies employ machine
learning models to classify DAs in tutoring dialogues and invest much effort to
optimize the classification accuracy by using limited amounts of training data
(i.e., low-resource data scenario). However, beyond the classification
accuracy, the robustness of the classifier is also important, which can reflect
the capability of the classifier on learning the patterns from different class
distributions. We note that many prior studies on classifying educational DAs
employ cross entropy (CE) loss to optimize DA classifiers on low-resource data
with imbalanced DA distribution. The DA classifiers in these studies tend to
prioritize accuracy on the majority class at the expense of the minority class
which might not be robust to the data with imbalanced ratios of different DA
classes. To optimize the robustness of classifiers on imbalanced class
distributions, we propose to optimize the performance of the DA classifier by
maximizing the area under the ROC curve (AUC) score (i.e., AUC maximization).
Through extensive experiments, our study provides evidence that (i) by
maximizing AUC in the training process, the DA classifier achieves significant
performance improvement compared to the CE approach under low-resource data,
and (ii) AUC maximization approaches can improve the robustness of the DA
classifier under different class imbalance ratios.",2023-04-15,2023,2023-04,education

voice-based CAs work, how they perceive their cognitive abilities, agency and
other human-like qualities, their awareness and trust of privacy aspects when
using CAs and what they perceive as appropriate verbal interactions with CAs.
Most children overestimated the CAs' intelligence and were uncertain about the
systems' feelings or agency. They also lacked accurate understanding of data
privacy and security aspects, and believed it was wrong to be rude to

delivering personalized learning experiences to address the unique needs of
each learner. An important subfield of adaptive learning is learning path
personalization: it aims at designing systems that recommend sequences of

learning approaches have already demonstrated significant results in a variety
of contexts related to learning path personalization. However, most of them
were designed for very specific settings and are not very reusable. This is
accentuated by the fact that they often rely on non-scalable models, which are
unable to integrate new elements after being trained on a specific set of
educational resources. In this paper, we introduce a flexible and scalable
approach towards the problem of learning path personalization, which we

"Leveraging Human Feedback to Scale Educational Datasets: Combining
  Crowdworkers and Comparative Judgement","Machine Learning models have many potentially beneficial applications in
education settings, but a key barrier to their development is securing enough
data to train these models. Labelling educational data has traditionally relied
on highly skilled raters using complex, multi-class rubrics, making the process
expensive and difficult to scale. An alternative, more scalable approach could
be to use non-expert crowdworkers to evaluate student work, however,
maintaining sufficiently high levels of accuracy and inter-rater reliability
when using non-expert workers is challenging. This paper reports on two
experiments investigating using non-expert crowdworkers and comparative
judgement to evaluate complex student data. Crowdworkers were hired to evaluate
student responses to open-ended reading comprehension questions. Crowdworkers
were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: the control, where they were
asked to decide whether answers were correct or incorrect (i.e., a categorical
judgement), or the treatment, where they were shown the same question and
answers, but were instead asked to decide which of two candidate answers was
more correct (i.e., a comparative/preference-based judgement). We found that
using comparative judgement substantially improved inter-rater reliability on
both tasks. These results are in-line with well-established literature on the
benefits of comparative judgement in the field of educational assessment, as
well as with recent trends in artificial intelligence research, where
comparative judgement is becoming the preferred method for providing human
feedback on model outputs when working with non-expert crowdworkers. However,
to our knowledge, these results are novel and important in demonstrating the
beneficial effects of using the combination of comparative judgement and
crowdworkers to evaluate educational data.",2023-05-22,2023,2023-05,education

"Using Large Language Models to Provide Explanatory Feedback to Human
  Tutors","Research demonstrates learners engaging in the process of producing
explanations to support their reasoning, can have a positive impact on
learning. However, providing learners real-time explanatory feedback often
presents challenges related to classification accuracy, particularly in
domain-specific environments, containing situationally complex and nuanced
responses. We present two approaches for supplying tutors real-time feedback
within an online lesson on how to give students effective praise. This
work-in-progress demonstrates considerable accuracy in binary classification
for corrective feedback of effective, or effort-based (F1 score = 0.811), and
ineffective, or outcome-based (F1 score = 0.350), praise responses. More
notably, we introduce progress towards an enhanced approach of providing
explanatory feedback using large language model-facilitated named entity
recognition, which can provide tutors feedback, not only while engaging in
lessons, but can potentially suggest real-time tutor moves. Future work
involves leveraging large language models for data augmentation to improve
accuracy, while also developing an explanatory feedback interface.",2023-06-27,2023,2023-06,education

computing education by powering next-generation educational technologies for
introductory programming. Recent works have studied these models for different
scenarios relevant to programming education; however, these works are limited
for several reasons, as they typically consider already outdated models or only
specific scenario(s). Consequently, there is a lack of a systematic study that
benchmarks state-of-the-art models for a comprehensive set of programming
education scenarios. In our work, we systematically evaluate two models,
ChatGPT (based on GPT-3.5) and GPT-4, and compare their performance with human
tutors for a variety of scenarios. We evaluate using five introductory Python
programming problems and real-world buggy programs from an online platform, and
assess performance using expert-based annotations. Our results show that GPT-4
drastically outperforms ChatGPT (based on GPT-3.5) and comes close to human
tutors' performance for several scenarios. These results also highlight

"Towards Anatomy Education with Generative AI-based Virtual Assistants in
  Immersive Virtual Reality Environments","Virtual reality (VR) and interactive 3D visualization systems have enhanced
educational experiences and environments, particularly in complicated subjects
such as anatomy education. VR-based systems surpass the potential limitations
of traditional training approaches in facilitating interactive engagement among
students. However, research on embodied virtual assistants that leverage
generative artificial intelligence (AI) and verbal communication in the anatomy
education context is underrepresented. In this work, we introduce a VR
environment with a generative AI-embodied virtual assistant to support
participants in responding to varying cognitive complexity anatomy questions
and enable verbal communication. We assessed the technical efficacy and
usability of the proposed environment in a pilot user study with 16
participants. We conducted a within-subject design for virtual assistant
configuration (avatar- and screen-based), with two levels of cognitive
complexity (knowledge- and analysis-based). The results reveal a significant
difference in the scores obtained from knowledge- and analysis-based questions
in relation to avatar configuration. Moreover, results provide insights into
usability, cognitive task load, and the sense of presence in the proposed
virtual assistant configurations. Our environment and results of the pilot

"The future of human-centric eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is
  not post-hoc explanations","Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) plays a crucial role in enabling
human understanding and trust in deep learning systems. As models get larger,
more ubiquitous, and pervasive in aspects of daily life, explainability is
necessary to minimize adverse effects of model mistakes. Unfortunately, current
approaches in human-centric XAI (e.g. predictive tasks in healthcare,
education, or personalized ads) tend to rely on a single post-hoc explainer,
whereas recent work has identified systematic disagreement between post-hoc
explainers when applied to the same instances of underlying black-box models.
In this paper, we therefore present a call for action to address the
limitations of current state-of-the-art explainers. We propose a shift from
post-hoc explainability to designing interpretable neural network
architectures. We identify five needs of human-centric XAI (real-time,
accurate, actionable, human-interpretable, and consistent) and propose two
schemes for interpretable-by-design neural network workflows (adaptive routing
with InterpretCC and temporal diagnostics with I2MD). We postulate that the
future of human-centric XAI is neither in explaining black-boxes nor in
reverting to traditional, interpretable models, but in neural networks that are
intrinsically interpretable.",2023-07-01,2023,2023-07,education

"Learning to Prompt in the Classroom to Understand AI Limits: A pilot
  study","Artificial intelligence's (AI) progress holds great promise in tackling
pressing societal concerns such as health and climate. Large Language Models
(LLM) and the derived chatbots, like ChatGPT, have highly improved the natural
language processing capabilities of AI systems allowing them to process an
unprecedented amount of unstructured data. However, the ensuing excitement has
led to negative sentiments, even as AI methods demonstrate remarkable
contributions (e.g. in health and genetics). A key factor contributing to this
sentiment is the misleading perception that LLMs can effortlessly provide
solutions across domains, ignoring their limitations such as hallucinations and
reasoning constraints. Acknowledging AI fallibility is crucial to address the
impact of dogmatic overconfidence in possibly erroneous suggestions generated
by LLMs. At the same time, it can reduce fear and other negative attitudes
toward AI. This necessitates comprehensive AI literacy interventions that
educate the public about LLM constraints and effective usage techniques, i.e
prompting strategies. With this aim, a pilot educational intervention was
performed in a high school with 21 students. It involved presenting high-level
concepts about intelligence, AI, and LLMs, followed by practical exercises
involving ChatGPT in creating natural educational conversations and applying
established prompting strategies. Encouraging preliminary results emerged,
including high appreciation of the activity, improved interaction quality with
the LLM, reduced negative AI sentiments, and a better grasp of limitations,
specifically unreliability, limited understanding of commands leading to
unsatisfactory responses, and limited presentation flexibility. Our aim is to

"Generative Adversarial Networks for Dental Patient Identity Protection
  in Orthodontic Educational Imaging","Objectives: This research introduces a novel area-preserving Generative
Adversarial Networks (GAN) inversion technique for effectively de-identifying
dental patient images. This innovative method addresses privacy concerns while
preserving key dental features, thereby generating valuable resources for
dental education and research.
  Methods: We enhanced the existing GAN Inversion methodology to maximize the
preservation of dental characteristics within the synthesized images. A
comprehensive technical framework incorporating several deep learning models
was developed to provide end-to-end development guidance and practical
application for image de-identification.
  Results: Our approach was assessed with varied facial pictures, extensively
used for diagnosing skeletal asymmetry and facial anomalies. Results
demonstrated our model's ability to adapt the context from one image to
another, maintaining compatibility, while preserving dental features essential
for oral diagnosis and dental education. A panel of five clinicians conducted
an evaluation on a set of original and GAN-processed images. The generated
images achieved effective de-identification, maintaining the realism of
important dental features and were deemed useful for dental diagnostics and
education.
  Clinical Significance: Our GAN model and the encompassing framework can
streamline the de-identification process of dental patient images, enhancing
efficiency in dental education. This method improves students' diagnostic
capabilities by offering more exposure to orthodontic malocclusions.
Furthermore, it facilitates the creation of de-identified datasets for broader

"Comparative Analysis of GPT-4 and Human Graders in Evaluating Praise
  Given to Students in Synthetic Dialogues","Research suggests that providing specific and timely feedback to human tutors
enhances their performance. However, it presents challenges due to the
time-consuming nature of assessing tutor performance by human evaluators. Large
language models, such as the AI-chatbot ChatGPT, hold potential for offering
constructive feedback to tutors in practical settings. Nevertheless, the
accuracy of AI-generated feedback remains uncertain, with scant research
investigating the ability of models like ChatGPT to deliver effective feedback.
In this work-in-progress, we evaluate 30 dialogues generated by GPT-4 in a
tutor-student setting. We use two different prompting approaches, the zero-shot
chain of thought and the few-shot chain of thought, to identify specific
components of effective praise based on five criteria. These approaches are
then compared to the results of human graders for accuracy. Our goal is to
assess the extent to which GPT-4 can accurately identify each praise criterion.
We found that both zero-shot and few-shot chain of thought approaches yield
comparable results. GPT-4 performs moderately well in identifying instances
when the tutor offers specific and immediate praise. However, GPT-4
underperforms in identifying the tutor's ability to deliver sincere praise,
particularly in the zero-shot prompting scenario where examples of sincere
tutor praise statements were not provided. Future work will focus on enhancing
prompt engineering, developing a more general tutoring rubric, and evaluating
our method using real-life tutoring dialogues.",2023-07-05,2023,2023-07,education

What Should Data Science Education Do with Large Language Models?,"The rapid advances of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, are
revolutionizing data science and statistics. These state-of-the-art tools can
streamline complex processes. As a result, it reshapes the role of data
scientists. We argue that LLMs are transforming the responsibilities of data
scientists, shifting their focus from hands-on coding, data-wrangling and
conducting standard analyses to assessing and managing analyses performed by
these automated AIs. This evolution of roles is reminiscent of the transition
from a software engineer to a product manager. We illustrate this transition
with concrete data science case studies using LLMs in this paper. These
developments necessitate a meaningful evolution in data science education.
Pedagogy must now place greater emphasis on cultivating diverse skillsets among
students, such as LLM-informed creativity, critical thinking, AI-guided
programming. LLMs can also play a significant role in the classroom as
interactive teaching and learning tools, contributing to personalized
education. This paper discusses the opportunities, resources and open
challenges for each of these directions. As with any transformative technology,
integrating LLMs into education calls for careful consideration. While LLMs can
perform repetitive tasks efficiently, it's crucial to remember that their role
is to supplement human intelligence and creativity, not to replace it.
Therefore, the new era of data science education should balance the benefits of
LLMs while fostering complementary human expertise and innovations. In
conclusion, the rise of LLMs heralds a transformative period for data science
and its education. This paper seeks to shed light on the emerging trends,
potential opportunities, and challenges accompanying this paradigm shift,

"Balancing Privacy and Progress in Artificial Intelligence: Anonymization
  in Histopathology for Biomedical Research and Education","The advancement of biomedical research heavily relies on access to large
amounts of medical data. In the case of histopathology, Whole Slide Images
(WSI) and clinicopathological information are valuable for developing
Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms for Digital Pathology (DP).
Transferring medical data ""as open as possible"" enhances the usability of the
data for secondary purposes but poses a risk to patient privacy. At the same
time, existing regulations push towards keeping medical data ""as closed as
necessary"" to avoid re-identification risks. Generally, these legal regulations
require the removal of sensitive data but do not consider the possibility of
data linkage attacks due to modern image-matching algorithms. In addition, the
lack of standardization in DP makes it harder to establish a single solution

  and Trust","This paper presents the results of an extensive study investigating the
opinions on Artificial Intelligence (AI) of a sample of 4,006 European citizens
from eight distinct countries (France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Poland,
Romania, Spain, and Sweden). The aim of the study is to gain a better
understanding of people's views and perceptions within the European context,
which is already marked by important policy actions and regulatory processes.
To survey the perceptions of the citizens of Europe we design and validate a
new questionnaire (PAICE) structured around three dimensions: people's
awareness, attitude, and trust. We observe that while awareness is
characterized by a low level of self-assessed competency, the attitude toward
AI is very positive for more than half of the population. Reflecting upon the
collected results, we highlight implicit contradictions and identify trends
that may interfere with the creation of an ecosystem of trust and the
development of inclusive AI policies. The introduction of rules that ensure
legal and ethical standards, along with the activity of high-level educational

historical and technological disruptions to provide context and then introduce
key terms such as machine learning and deep learning and the underlying
mechanisms of recent advancements, namely attention/transformer models and
graphics processing units. The heart of our investigation lies in the
application of an LLM-based chatbot in a graduate fluid mechanics course. We

"The Impact of AI in Physics Education: A Comprehensive Review from GCSE
  to University Levels","With the rapid evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI), its potential
implications for higher education have become a focal point of interest. This
study delves into the capabilities of AI in Physics Education and offers
actionable AI policy recommendations. Using a Large Language Model (LLM), we
assessed its ability to answer 1337 Physics exam questions spanning GCSE,
A-Level, and Introductory University curricula. We employed various AI
prompting techniques: Zero Shot, In Context Learning, and Confirmatory
Checking, which merges Chain of Thought reasoning with Reflection. The AI's
proficiency varied across academic levels: it scored an average of 83.4% on
GCSE, 63.8% on A-Level, and 37.4% on university-level questions, with an
overall average of 59.9% using the most effective prompting technique. In a
separate test, the LLM's accuracy on 5000 mathematical operations was found to
decrease as the number of digits increased. Furthermore, when evaluated as a
marking tool, the LLM's concordance with human markers averaged at 50.8%, with
notable inaccuracies in marking straightforward questions, like
multiple-choice. Given these results, our recommendations underscore caution:
while current LLMs can consistently perform well on Physics questions at
earlier educational stages, their efficacy diminishes with advanced content and
complex calculations. LLM outputs often showcase novel methods not in the
syllabus, excessive verbosity, and miscalculations in basic arithmetic. This
suggests that at university, there's no substantial threat from LLMs for
non-invigilated Physics questions. However, given the LLMs' considerable
proficiency in writing Physics essays and coding abilities, non-invigilated
examinations of these skills in Physics are highly vulnerable to automated
completion by LLMs. This vulnerability also extends to Physics questions
pitched at lower academic levels.",2023-09-10,2023,2023-09,education

An Empirical Study of AI Generated Text Detection Tools,"Since ChatGPT has emerged as a major AIGC model, providing high-quality
responses across a wide range of applications (including software development
and maintenance), it has attracted much interest from many individuals. ChatGPT
has great promise, but there are serious problems that might arise from its
misuse, especially in the realms of education and public safety. Several AIGC
detectors are available, and they have all been tested on genuine text.
However, more study is needed to see how effective they are for multi-domain
ChatGPT material. This study aims to fill this need by creating a multi-domain
dataset for testing the state-of-the-art APIs and tools for detecting
artificially generated information used by universities and other research
institutions. A large dataset consisting of articles, abstracts, stories, news,
and product reviews was created for this study. The second step is to use the
newly created dataset to put six tools through their paces. Six different
artificial intelligence (AI) text identification systems, including ""GPTkit,""
""GPTZero,"" ""Originality,"" ""Sapling,"" ""Writer,"" and ""Zylalab,"" have accuracy

Generative AI in the Classroom: Can Students Remain Active Learners?,"Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) can be seen as a double-edged weapon
in education. Indeed, it may provide personalized, interactive and empowering
pedagogical sequences that could favor students' intrinsic motivation, active
engagement and help them have more control over their learning. But at the same
time, other GAI properties such as the lack of uncertainty signalling even in
cases of failure (particularly with Large Language Models (LLMs)) could lead to
opposite effects, e.g. over-estimation of one's own competencies, passiveness,
loss of curious and critical-thinking sense, etc.
  These negative effects are due in particular to the lack of a pedagogical
stance in these models' behaviors. Indeed, as opposed to standard pedagogical
activities, GAI systems are often designed to answers users' inquiries easily
and conveniently, without asking them to make an effort, and without focusing
on their learning process and/or outcomes.
  This article starts by outlining some of these opportunities and challenges
surrounding the use of GAI in education, with a focus on the effects on
students' active learning strategies and related metacognitive skills. Then, we
present a framework for introducing pedagogical transparency in GAI-based
educational applications. This framework presents 1) training methods to
include pedagogical principles in the models, 2) methods to ensure controlled
and pedagogically-relevant interactions when designing activities with GAI and
3) educational methods enabling students to acquire the relevant skills to

"Opportunities for Adaptive Experiments to Enable Continuous Improvement
  in Computer Science Education","Randomized A/B comparisons of alternative pedagogical strategies or other
course improvements could provide useful empirical evidence for instructor
decision-making. However, traditional experiments do not provide a
straightforward pathway to rapidly utilize data, increasing the chances that
students in an experiment experience the best conditions. Drawing inspiration
from the use of machine learning and experimentation in product development at
leading technology companies, we explore how adaptive experimentation might aid
continuous course improvement. In adaptive experiments, data is analyzed and
utilized as different conditions are deployed to students. This can be achieved
using machine learning algorithms to identify which actions are more beneficial
in improving students' learning experiences and outcomes. These algorithms can
then dynamically deploy the most effective conditions in subsequent
interactions with students, resulting in better support for students' needs. We
illustrate this approach with a case study that provides a side-by-side

"Leveraging generative artificial intelligence to simulate student
  learning behavior","Student simulation presents a transformative approach to enhance learning
outcomes, advance educational research, and ultimately shape the future of
effective pedagogy. We explore the feasibility of using large language models

Unlike conventional machine learning based prediction, we leverage LLMs to
instantiate virtual students with specific demographics and uncover intricate
correlations among learning experiences, course materials, understanding
levels, and engagement. Our objective is not merely to predict learning
outcomes but to replicate learning behaviors and patterns of real students. We
validate this hypothesis through three experiments. The first experiment, based
on a dataset of N = 145, simulates student learning outcomes from demographic
data, revealing parallels with actual students concerning various demographic
factors. The second experiment (N = 4524) results in increasingly realistic
simulated behaviors with more assessment history for virtual students
modelling. The third experiment (N = 27), incorporating prior knowledge and
course interactions, indicates a strong link between virtual students' learning
behaviors and fine-grained mappings from test questions, course materials,

"Augmenting deep neural networks with symbolic knowledge: Towards
  trustworthy and interpretable AI for education","Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have shown to be amongst the most important
artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in educational applications, providing
adaptive educational services. However, their educational potential is limited
in practice due to three major challenges: i) difficulty in incorporating
symbolic educational knowledge (e.g., causal relationships, and practitioners'
knowledge) in their development, ii) learning and reflecting biases, and iii)
lack of interpretability. Given the high-risk nature of education, the
integration of educational knowledge into ANNs becomes crucial for developing
AI applications that adhere to essential educational restrictions, and provide
interpretability over the predictions. This research argues that the
neural-symbolic family of AI has the potential to address the named challenges.
To this end, it adapts a neural-symbolic AI framework and accordingly develops
an approach called NSAI, that injects and extracts educational knowledge into
and from deep neural networks, for modelling learners computational thinking.
Our findings reveal that the NSAI approach has better generalizability compared
to deep neural networks trained merely on training data, as well as training
data augmented by SMOTE and autoencoder methods. More importantly, unlike the
other models, the NSAI approach prioritises robust representations that capture
causal relationships between input features and output labels, ensuring safety
in learning to avoid spurious correlations and control biases in training data.
Furthermore, the NSAI approach enables the extraction of rules from the learned
network, facilitating interpretation and reasoning about the path to
predictions, as well as refining the initial educational knowledge. These
findings imply that neural-symbolic AI can overcome the limitations of ANNs in

"EduGym: An Environment and Notebook Suite for Reinforcement Learning
  Education","Due to the empirical success of reinforcement learning, an increasing number
of students study the subject. However, from our practical teaching experience,
we see students entering the field (bachelor, master and early PhD) often
struggle. On the one hand, textbooks and (online) lectures provide the
fundamentals, but students find it hard to translate between equations and
code. On the other hand, public codebases do provide practical examples, but
the implemented algorithms tend to be complex, and the underlying test
environments contain multiple reinforcement learning challenges at once.
Although this is realistic from a research perspective, it often hinders
educational conceptual understanding. To solve this issue we introduce EduGym,
a set of educational reinforcement learning environments and associated
interactive notebooks tailored for education. Each EduGym environment is
specifically designed to illustrate a certain aspect/challenge of reinforcement
learning (e.g., exploration, partial observability, stochasticity, etc.), while
the associated interactive notebook explains the challenge and its possible
solution approaches, connecting equations and code in a single document. An
evaluation among RL students and researchers shows 86% of them think EduGym is
a useful tool for reinforcement learning education. All notebooks are available

Education distillation:getting student models to learn in shcools,"This paper introduces a new knowledge distillation method, called education
distillation (ED), which is inspired by the structured and progressive nature
of human learning. ED mimics the educational stages of primary school, middle
school, and university and designs teaching reference blocks. The student model
is split into a main body and multiple teaching reference blocks to learn from
teachers step by step. This promotes efficient knowledge distillation while
maintaining the architecture of the student model. Experimental results on the
CIFAR100, Tiny Imagenet, Caltech and Food-101 datasets show that the teaching
reference blocks can effectively avoid the problem of forgetting. Compared with
conventional single-teacher and multi-teacher knowledge distillation methods,
ED significantly improves the accuracy and generalization ability of the

"Students' Perceptions and Preferences of Generative Artificial
  Intelligence Feedback for Programming","The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI), specifically large
language models (LLMs), has opened opportunities for various educational
applications. This paper explored the feasibility of utilizing ChatGPT, one of
the most popular LLMs, for automating feedback for Java programming assignments
in an introductory computer science (CS1) class. Specifically, this study
focused on three questions: 1) To what extent do students view LLM-generated
feedback as formative? 2) How do students see the comparative affordances of
feedback prompts that include their code, vs. those that exclude it? 3) What
enhancements do students suggest for improving AI-generated feedback? To
address these questions, we generated automated feedback using the ChatGPT API
for four lab assignments in the CS1 class. The survey results revealed that
students perceived the feedback as aligning well with formative feedback
guidelines established by Shute. Additionally, students showed a clear
preference for feedback generated by including the students' code as part of
the LLM prompt, and our thematic study indicated that the preference was mainly
attributed to the specificity, clarity, and corrective nature of the feedback.
Moreover, this study found that students generally expected specific and
corrective feedback with sufficient code examples, but had diverged opinions on
the tone of the feedback. This study demonstrated that ChatGPT could generate
Java programming assignment feedback that students perceived as formative. It
also offered insights into the specific improvements that would make the
ChatGPT-generated feedback useful for students.",2023-12-17,2023,2023-12,education

Skills or Degree? The Rise of Skill-Based Hiring for AI and Green Jobs,"Emerging professions in fields like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
sustainability (green jobs) are experiencing labour shortages as industry
demand outpaces labour supply. In this context, our study aims to understand
whether employers have begun focusing more on individual skills rather than
formal qualifications in their recruitment processes. We analysed a large
time-series dataset of approximately eleven million online job vacancies in the
UK from 2018 to mid-2024, drawing on diverse literature on technological change
and labour market signalling. Our findings provide evidence that employers have
initiated ""skill-based hiring"" for AI roles, adopting more flexible hiring
practices to expand the available talent pool. From 2018-2023, demand for AI
roles grew by 21% as a proportion of all postings (and accelerated into 2024).
Simultaneously, mentions of university education requirements for AI roles
declined by 15%. Our regression analysis shows that university degrees have a
significantly lower wage premium for both AI and green roles. In contrast, AI
skills command a wage premium of 23%, exceeding the value of degrees up until
the PhD-level (33%). In occupations with high demand for AI skills, the premium
for skills is high, and the reward for degrees is relatively low. We recommend
leveraging alternative skill-building formats such as apprenticeships,
on-the-job training, MOOCs, vocational education and training,
micro-certificates, and online bootcamps to fully utilise human capital and
address talent shortages.",2023-12-19,2023,2023-12,education

the study examined both models' abilities to read text-based rubrics and then
automatically score student-drawn models in science education. We employed both
quantitative and qualitative analyses using a dataset derived from
student-drawn scientific models and employing NERIF (Notation-Enhanced Rubrics

significantly outperforms Gemini Pro in terms of scoring accuracy and Quadratic
Weighted Kappa. The qualitative analysis reveals that the differences may be
due to the models' ability to process fine-grained texts in images and overall
image classification performance. Even adapting the NERIF approach by further
de-sizing the input images, Gemini Pro seems not able to perform as well as
GPT-4V. The findings suggest GPT-4V's superior capability in handling complex

Mastery Guided Non-parametric Clustering to Scale-up Strategy Prediction,"Predicting the strategy (sequence of concepts) that a student is likely to
use in problem-solving helps Adaptive Instructional Systems (AISs) better adapt
themselves to different types of learners based on their learning abilities.
This can lead to a more dynamic, engaging, and personalized experience for

large-scale education datasets, we develop a non-parametric approach to cluster
symmetric instances in the data. Specifically, we learn a representation based
on Node2Vec that encodes symmetries over mastery or skill level since, to solve
a problem, it is natural that a student's strategy is likely to involve
concepts in which they have gained mastery. Using this representation, we use
DP-Means to group symmetric instances through a coarse-to-fine refinement of
the clusters. We apply our model to learn strategies for Math learning from
large-scale datasets from MATHia, a leading AIS for middle-school math
learning. Our results illustrate that our approach can consistently achieve
high accuracy using a small sample that is representative of the full dataset.
Further, we show that this approach helps us learn strategies with high

"Identifying Student Profiles Within Online Judge Systems Using
  Explainable Artificial Intelligence","Online Judge (OJ) systems are typically considered within programming-related
courses as they yield fast and objective assessments of the code developed by
the students. Such an evaluation generally provides a single decision based on
a rubric, most commonly whether the submission successfully accomplished the
assignment. Nevertheless, since in an educational context such information may
be deemed insufficient, it would be beneficial for both the student and the
instructor to receive additional feedback about the overall development of the
task. This work aims to tackle this limitation by considering the further
exploitation of the information gathered by the OJ and automatically inferring
feedback for both the student and the instructor. More precisely, we consider
the use of learning-based schemes -- particularly, multi-instance learning
(MIL) and classical machine learning formulations -- to model student behavior.
Besides, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is contemplated to provide
human-understandable feedback. The proposal has been evaluated considering a
case of study comprising 2500 submissions from roughly 90 different students
from a programming-related course in a computer science degree. The results
obtained validate the proposal: The model is capable of significantly
predicting the user outcome (either passing or failing the assignment) solely
based on the behavioral pattern inferred by the submissions provided to the OJ.
Moreover, the proposal is able to identify prone-to-fail student groups and

  Review","When technical requirements are high, and patient outcomes are critical,
opportunities for monitoring and improving surgical skills via objective motion
analysis feedback may be particularly beneficial. This narrative review
synthesises work on technical and non-technical surgical skills, collaborative
task performance, and pose estimation to illustrate new opportunities to
advance cardiothoracic surgical performance with innovations from computer
vision and artificial intelligence. These technological innovations are
critically evaluated in terms of the benefits they could offer the
cardiothoracic surgical community, and any barriers to the uptake of the
technology are elaborated upon. Like some other specialities, cardiothoracic
surgery has relatively few opportunities to benefit from tools with data
capture technology embedded within them (as with robotic-assisted laparoscopic
surgery, for example). In such cases, pose estimation techniques that allow for
movement tracking across a conventional operating field without using
specialist equipment or markers offer considerable potential. With video data
from either simulated or real surgical procedures, these tools can (1) provide
insight into the development of expertise and surgical performance over a
surgeon's career, (2) provide feedback to trainee surgeons regarding areas for
improvement, (3) provide the opportunity to investigate what aspects of skill
may be linked to patient outcomes which can (4) inform the aspects of surgical
skill which should be focused on within training or mentoring programmes.
Classifier or assessment algorithms that use artificial intelligence to 'learn'
what expertise is from expert surgical evaluators could further assist
educators in determining if trainees meet competency thresholds.",2024-02-17,2024,2024-02,education
"From Cloud to Edge: Rethinking Generative AI for Low-Resource Design
  Challenges","Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has shown tremendous prospects in all
aspects of technology, including design. However, due to its heavy demand on
resources, it is usually trained on large computing infrastructure and often
made available as a cloud-based service. In this position paper, we consider
the potential, challenges, and promising approaches for generative AI for
design on the edge, i.e., in resource-constrained settings where memory,
compute, energy (battery) and network connectivity may be limited. Adapting
generative AI for such settings involves overcoming significant hurdles,
primarily in how to streamline complex models to function efficiently in
low-resource environments. This necessitates innovative approaches in model
compression, efficient algorithmic design, and perhaps even leveraging edge
computing. The objective is to harness the power of generative AI in creating
bespoke solutions for design problems, such as medical interventions, farm
equipment maintenance, and educational material design, tailored to the unique
constraints and needs of remote areas. These efforts could democratize access
to advanced technology and foster sustainable development, ensuring universal
accessibility and environmental consideration of AI-driven design benefits.",2024-02-20,2024,2024-02,education
DREsS: Dataset for Rubric-based Essay Scoring on EFL Writing,"Automated essay scoring (AES) is a useful tool in English as a Foreign
Language (EFL) writing education, offering real-time essay scores for students
and instructors. However, previous AES models were trained on essays and scores
irrelevant to the practical scenarios of EFL writing education and usually
provided a single holistic score due to the lack of appropriate datasets. In
this paper, we release DREsS, a large-scale, standard dataset for rubric-based
automated essay scoring. DREsS comprises three sub-datasets: DREsS_New,
DREsS_Std., and DREsS_CASE. We collect DREsS_New, a real-classroom dataset with
2.3K essays authored by EFL undergraduate students and scored by English
education experts. We also standardize existing rubric-based essay scoring
datasets as DREsS_Std. We suggest CASE, a corruption-based augmentation
strategy for essays, which generates 40.1K synthetic samples of DREsS_CASE and
improves the baseline results by 45.44%. DREsS will enable further research to
provide a more accurate and practical AES system for EFL writing education.",2024-02-21,2024,2024-02,education

"Improving the Validity of Automatically Generated Feedback via
  Reinforcement Learning","Automatically generating feedback via large language models (LLMs) in
intelligent tutoring systems and online learning platforms has the potential to
improve the learning outcomes of many students. However, both feedback
generation and evaluation are challenging: feedback content has to be valid
especially in subjects like math, which requires models to understand the
problem, the solution, and where the student's error lies. Feedback also has to
be pedagogically valid to reflect effective tutoring strategies, such as
explaining possible misconceptions and encouraging the student, among other
desirable features. In this work, we address both problems of automatically
generating and evaluating feedback while considering both correctness and
alignment. First, we propose a rubric for evaluating math feedback and show
that GPT-4 is able to effectively use it to annotate human-written and
LLM-generated feedback. Second, we propose a framework for feedback generation
that optimizes both correctness and alignment using reinforcement learning
(RL). Specifically, we use GPT-4's annotations to create preferences over
feedback pairs in an augmented dataset for training via direct preference
optimization (DPO). We show that our methods significantly increase the
correctness and alignment of generated feedback with Llama 2, an open-source
LLM, qualitatively analyze our generation and evaluation systems using case
studies, and outline several areas for future work.",2024-03-02,2024,2024-03,education
"Evaluating and Optimizing Educational Content with Large Language Model
  Judgments","Creating effective educational materials generally requires expensive and
time-consuming studies of student learning outcomes. To overcome this barrier,
one idea is to build computational models of student learning and use them to
optimize instructional materials. However, it is difficult to model the
cognitive processes of learning dynamics. We propose an alternative approach
that uses Language Models (LMs) as educational experts to assess the impact of
various instructions on learning outcomes. Specifically, we use GPT-3.5 to
evaluate the overall effect of instructional materials on different student
groups and find that it can replicate well-established educational findings
such as the Expertise Reversal Effect and the Variability Effect. This
demonstrates the potential of LMs as reliable evaluators of educational
content. Building on this insight, we introduce an instruction optimization
approach in which one LM generates instructional materials using the judgments
of another LM as a reward function. We apply this approach to create math word
problem worksheets aimed at maximizing student learning gains. Human teachers'
evaluations of these LM-generated worksheets show a significant alignment
between the LM judgments and human teacher preferences. We conclude by
discussing potential divergences between human and LM opinions and the
resulting pitfalls of automating instructional design.",2024-03-05,2024,2024-03,education

"Legally Binding but Unfair? Towards Assessing Fairness of Privacy
  Policies","Privacy policies are expected to inform data subjects about their data
protection rights and should explain the data controller's data management
practices. Privacy policies only fulfill their purpose, if they are correctly
interpreted, understood, and trusted by the data subject. This implies that a
privacy policy is written in a fair way, e.g., it does not use polarizing
terms, does not require a certain education, or does not assume a particular
social background. We outline our approach to assessing fairness in privacy
policies. We identify from fundamental legal sources and fairness research, how
the dimensions informational fairness, representational fairness and ethics /
morality are related to privacy policies. We propose options to automatically
assess policies in these fairness dimensions, based on text statistics,
linguistic methods and artificial intelligence. We conduct initial experiments
with German privacy policies to provide evidence that our approach is
applicable. Our experiments indicate that there are issues in all three
dimensions of fairness. This is important, as future privacy policies may be
used in a corpus for legal artificial intelligence models.",2024-03-12,2024,2024-03,education
A Survey of Explainable Knowledge Tracing,"With the long term accumulation of high quality educational data, artificial
intelligence has shown excellent performance in knowledge tracing. However, due
to the lack of interpretability and transparency of some algorithms, this
approach will result in reduced stakeholder trust and a decreased acceptance of
intelligent decisions. Therefore, algorithms need to achieve high accuracy, and
users need to understand the internal operating mechanism and provide reliable
explanations for decisions. This paper thoroughly analyzes the interpretability
of KT algorithms. First, the concepts and common methods of explainable
artificial intelligence and knowledge tracing are introduced. Next, explainable
knowledge tracing models are classified into two categories: transparent models
and black box models. Then, the interpretable methods used are reviewed from
three stages: ante hoc interpretable methods, post hoc interpretable methods,
and other dimensions. It is worth noting that current evaluation methods for
explainable knowledge tracing are lacking. Hence, contrast and deletion
experiments are conducted to explain the prediction results of the deep
knowledge tracing model on the ASSISTment2009 by using three XAI methods.
Moreover, this paper offers some insights into evaluation methods from the
perspective of educational stakeholders. This paper provides a detailed and

innovativeness, discomfort, insecurity, and others. Using a research method
that encompasses a comprehensive analysis of extant literature from databases
such as IEEE, ACM, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar, the study aims to
comprehend the implications of AI Chatbots on higher education and pinpoint
critical elements for their efficacious implementation. Peer-reviewed
English-language publications published between 2020 and 2023 with a focus on
the use of AI chatbots in higher education were the main focus of the search
criteria. The results demonstrate how much AI chatbots can do to improve
student engagement, streamline the educational process, and support

"Automated Assessment of Encouragement and Warmth in Classrooms
  Leveraging Multimodal Emotional Features and ChatGPT","Classroom observation protocols standardize the assessment of teaching
effectiveness and facilitate comprehension of classroom interactions. Whereas
these protocols offer teachers specific feedback on their teaching practices,
the manual coding by human raters is resource-intensive and often unreliable.
This has sparked interest in developing AI-driven, cost-effective methods for
automating such holistic coding. Our work explores a multimodal approach to
automatically estimating encouragement and warmth in classrooms, a key
component of the Global Teaching Insights (GTI) study's observation protocol.
To this end, we employed facial and speech emotion recognition with sentiment
analysis to extract interpretable features from video, audio, and transcript
data. The prediction task involved both classification and regression methods.
Additionally, in light of recent large language models' remarkable text
annotation capabilities, we evaluated ChatGPT's zero-shot performance on this
scoring task based on transcripts. We demonstrated our approach on the GTI
dataset, comprising 367 16-minute video segments from 92 authentic lesson
recordings. The inferences of GPT-4 and the best-trained model yielded
correlations of r = .341 and r = .441 with human ratings, respectively.
Combining estimates from both models through averaging, an ensemble approach
achieved a correlation of r = .513, comparable to human inter-rater
reliability. Our model explanation analysis indicated that text sentiment
features were the primary contributors to the trained model's decisions.
Moreover, GPT-4 could deliver logical and concrete reasoning as potential
teacher guidelines. Our findings provide insights into using advanced,
multimodal techniques for automated classroom observation, aiming to foster
teacher training through frequent and valuable feedback.",2024-04-01,2024,2024-04,education

"The Promises and Pitfalls of Using Language Models to Measure
  Instruction Quality in Education","Assessing instruction quality is a fundamental component of any improvement
efforts in the education system. However, traditional manual assessments are
expensive, subjective, and heavily dependent on observers' expertise and
idiosyncratic factors, preventing teachers from getting timely and frequent
feedback. Different from prior research that mostly focuses on low-inference
instructional practices on a singular basis, this paper presents the first
study that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to assess
multiple high-inference instructional practices in two distinct educational
settings: in-person K-12 classrooms and simulated performance tasks for
pre-service teachers. This is also the first study that applies NLP to measure
a teaching practice that is widely acknowledged to be particularly effective
for students with special needs. We confront two challenges inherent in
NLP-based instructional analysis, including noisy and long input data and
highly skewed distributions of human ratings. Our results suggest that
pretrained Language Models (PLMs) demonstrate performances comparable to the
agreement level of human raters for variables that are more discrete and
require lower inference, but their efficacy diminishes with more complex
teaching practices. Interestingly, using only teachers' utterances as input
yields strong results for student-centered variables, alleviating common
concerns over the difficulty of collecting and transcribing high-quality

"Deepfakes and Higher Education: A Research Agenda and Scoping Review of
  Synthetic Media","The availability of software which can produce convincing yet synthetic media
poses both threats and benefits to tertiary education globally. While other
forms of synthetic media exist, this study focuses on deepfakes, which are
advanced Generative AI (GenAI) fakes of real people. This conceptual paper
assesses the current literature on deepfakes across multiple disciplines by
conducting an initial scoping review of 182 peer-reviewed publications.
  The review reveals three major trends: detection methods, malicious
applications, and potential benefits, although no specific studies on deepfakes
in the tertiary educational context were found. Following a discussion of these
trends, this study applies the findings to postulate the major risks and
potential mitigation strategies of deepfake technologies in higher education,
as well as potential beneficial uses to aid the teaching and learning of both
deepfakes and synthetic media. This culminates in the proposal of a research
agenda to build a comprehensive, cross-cultural approach to investigate
deepfakes in higher education.",2024-04-24,2024,2024-04,education
"Leveraging Prompts in LLMs to Overcome Imbalances in Complex Educational
  Text Data","In this paper, we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) with
assertions to mitigate imbalances in educational datasets. Traditional models
often fall short in such contexts, particularly due to the complexity and
nuanced nature of the data. This issue is especially prominent in the education
sector, where cognitive engagement levels among students show significant
variation in their open responses. To test our hypothesis, we utilized an
existing technology for assertion-based prompt engineering through an
'Iterative - ICL PE Design Process' comparing traditional Machine Learning (ML)
models against LLMs augmented with assertions (N=135). Further, we conduct a
sensitivity analysis on a subset (n=27), examining the variance in model
performance concerning classification metrics and cognitive engagement levels
in each iteration. Our findings reveal that LLMs with assertions significantly
outperform traditional ML models, particularly in cognitive engagement levels
with minority representation, registering up to a 32% increase in F1-score.
Additionally, our sensitivity study indicates that incorporating targeted
assertions into the LLM tested on the subset enhances its performance by
11.94%. This improvement primarily addresses errors stemming from the model's
limitations in understanding context and resolving lexical ambiguities in
student responses.",2024-04-28,2024,2024-04,education

such as privacy concerns. Another complementary strategy involves using
generative artificial intelligence to empower adolescents by educating them
about predatory behaviors. To this end, we envision developing state-of-the-art
conversational agents to simulate the conversations between adolescents and
predators for educational purposes. Yet, one key challenge is the lack of a
dataset to train such conversational agents. In this position paper, we present
our motivation for empowering adolescents to cope with cybergrooming. We
propose to develop large-scale, authentic datasets through an online survey
targeting adolescents and parents. We discuss some initial background behind
our motivation and proposed design of the survey, such as situating the
participants in artificial cybergrooming scenarios, then allowing participants
to respond to the survey to obtain their authentic responses. We also present
several open questions related to our proposed approach and hope to discuss
them with the workshop attendees.",2024-05-21,2024,2024-05,education

"Towards Educator-Driven Tutor Authoring: Generative AI Approaches for
  Creating Intelligent Tutor Interfaces","Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) have shown great potential in delivering
personalized and adaptive education, but their widespread adoption has been
hindered by the need for specialized programming and design skills. Existing
approaches overcome the programming limitations with no-code authoring through
drag and drop, however they assume that educators possess the necessary skills
to design effective and engaging tutor interfaces. To address this assumption
we introduce generative AI capabilities to assist educators in creating tutor
interfaces that meet their needs while adhering to design principles. Our
approach leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and prompt engineering to
generate tutor layout and contents based on high-level requirements provided by
educators as inputs. However, to allow them to actively participate in the
design process, rather than relying entirely on AI-generated solutions, we
allow generation both at the entire interface level and at the individual
component level. The former provides educators with a complete interface that
can be refined using direct manipulation, while the latter offers the ability
to create specific elements to be added to the tutor interface. A small-scale
comparison shows the potential of our approach to enhance the efficiency of
tutor interface design. Moving forward, we raise critical questions for
assisting educators with generative AI capabilities to create personalized,
effective, and engaging tutors, ultimately enhancing their adoption.",2024-05-23,2024,2024-05,education
ChatGPT Code Detection: Techniques for Uncovering the Source of Code,"In recent times, large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides
in generating computer code, blurring the lines between code created by humans
and code produced by artificial intelligence (AI). As these technologies evolve
rapidly, it is crucial to explore how they influence code generation,
especially given the risk of misuse in areas like higher education. This paper
explores this issue by using advanced classification techniques to
differentiate between code written by humans and that generated by ChatGPT, a
type of LLM. We employ a new approach that combines powerful embedding features
(black-box) with supervised learning algorithms - including Deep Neural
Networks, Random Forests, and Extreme Gradient Boosting - to achieve this
differentiation with an impressive accuracy of 98%. For the successful
combinations, we also examine their model calibration, showing that some of the
models are extremely well calibrated. Additionally, we present white-box
features and an interpretable Bayes classifier to elucidate critical
differences between the code sources, enhancing the explainability and
transparency of our approach. Both approaches work well but provide at most
85-88% accuracy. We also show that untrained humans solve the same task not
better than random guessing. This study is crucial in understanding and
mitigating the potential risks associated with using AI in code generation,
particularly in the context of higher education, software development, and
competitive programming.",2024-05-24,2024,2024-05,education

the resources required to provide dedicated training in leading difficult
conversations has been a long-standing problem in medical education.
  Approach: In this work, we present a novel educational tool designed to
facilitate interactive, real-time simulations of difficult conversations in a
video-based format through the use of multimodal generative artificial
intelligence (AI). Leveraging recent advances in language modeling, computer
vision, and generative audio, this tool creates realistic, interactive
scenarios with avatars, or ""synthetic patients."" These synthetic patients
interact with users throughout various stages of medical care using a

conversations with patients from diverse belief systems, personalities, and
ethnic backgrounds.
  Outcomes: While the development of this platform demanded substantial upfront
investment in labor, it offers a highly-realistic simulation experience with
minimal financial investment. For medical trainees, this educational tool can
be implemented within programs to simulate patient-provider conversations and
can be incorporated into existing palliative care curriculum to provide a
scalable, high-fidelity simulation environment for mastering difficult

Our work investigates the current landscape of introductory AI courses on
YouTube, and the potential for introducing ethics in this context. We
qualitatively analyze the 20 most watched introductory AI courses on YouTube,
coding a total of 92.2 hours of educational content viewed by close to 50
million people. Introductory AI courses do not meaningfully engage with ethical

anthropomorphize AI (RQ2). In \textit{teaching AI}, we see a widespread
reliance on corporate AI tools and frameworks as well as a prioritization on a
hands-on approach to learning rather than on conceptual foundations (RQ3). In
promoting key \textit{AI practices}, introductory AI courses abstract away
entirely the socio-technical nature of AI classification and prediction, for
example by favoring data quantity over data quality (RQ4). We extend our
analysis with recommendations that aim to integrate ethical reflections into

"Generative AI and Digital Neocolonialism in Global Education: Towards an
  Equitable Framework","This paper critically discusses how generative artificial intelligence
(GenAI) might impose Western ideologies on non-Western societies, perpetuating
digital neocolonialism in education through its inherent biases. It further
suggests strategies for local and global stakeholders to mitigate these
effects. Our discussions demonstrated that GenAI can foster cultural
imperialism by generating content that primarily incorporates cultural
references and examples relevant to Western students, thereby alienating
students from non-Western backgrounds. Also, the predominant use of Western
languages by GenAI can marginalize non-dominant languages, making educational
content less accessible to speakers of indigenous languages and potentially
impacting their ability to learn in their first language. Additionally, GenAI
often generates content and curricula that reflect the perspectives of
technologically dominant countries, overshadowing marginalized indigenous
knowledge and practices. Moreover, the cost of access to GenAI intensifies
educational inequality and the control of GenAI data could lead to commercial
exploitation without benefiting local students and their communities. We
propose human-centric reforms to prioritize cultural diversity and equity in
GenAI development; a liberatory design to empower educators and students to
identify and dismantle the oppressive structures within GenAI applications;
foresight by design to create an adjustable GenAI system to meet future
educational needs; and finally, effective prompting skills to reduce the

deep-learning knowledge tracing (DLKT) models that prioritize high predictive
accuracy. However, many existing DLKT methods overlook the fundamental goal of
tracking students' dynamical knowledge mastery. These models do not explicitly
model knowledge mastery tracing processes or yield unreasonable results that
educators find difficulty to comprehend and apply in real teaching scenarios.
In response, our research conducts a preliminary analysis of mainstream KT

"Evaluation of Large Language Models: STEM education and Gender
  Stereotypes","Large Language Models (LLMs) have an increasing impact on our lives with use
cases such as chatbots, study support, coding support, ideation, writing
assistance, and more. Previous studies have revealed linguistic biases in
pronouns used to describe professions or adjectives used to describe men vs
women. These issues have to some degree been addressed in updated LLM versions,
at least to pass existing tests. However, biases may still be present in the
models, and repeated use of gender stereotypical language may reinforce the
underlying assumptions and are therefore important to examine further. This
paper investigates gender biases in LLMs in relation to educational choices
through an open-ended, true to user-case experimental design and a quantitative
analysis. We investigate the biases in the context of four different cultures,
languages, and educational systems (English/US/UK, Danish/DK, Catalan/ES, and
Hindi/IN) for ages ranging from 10 to 16 years, corresponding to important
educational transition points in the different countries. We find that there
are significant and large differences in the ratio of STEM to non-STEM
suggested education paths provided by chatGPT when using typical girl vs boy
names to prompt lists of suggested things to become. There are generally fewer
STEM suggestions in the Danish, Spanish, and Indian context compared to the
English. We also find subtle differences in the suggested professions, which we
categorise and report.",2024-06-14,2024,2024-06,education
"Validating an Instrument for Teachers' Acceptance of Artificial
  Intelligence in Education","As artificial intelligence (AI) receives wider attention in education,
examining teachers' acceptance of AI (TAAI) becomes essential. However,
existing instruments measuring TAAI reported limited reliability and validity
evidence and faced some design challenges, such as missing informed definitions
of AI to participants. This study aimed to develop and validate a TAAI
instrument, with providing sufficient evidence for high psychometric quality.
Based on the literature, we first identified five dimensions of TAAI, including
perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, behavioral intention,
self-efficacy, and anxiety, and then developed items to assess each dimension.
We examined the face and content validity using expert review and think-aloud
with pre-service teachers. Using the revised instrument, we collected responses
from 274 pre-service teachers and examined the item discriminations to identify
outlier items. We employed the confirmatory factor analysis and Cronbach's
alpha to examine the construct validity, convergent validity, discriminant
validity, and reliability. Results confirmed the dimensionality of the scale,
resulting in 27 items distributed in five dimensions. The study exhibits robust
validity and reliability evidence for TAAI, thus affirming its usefulness as a
valid measurement instrument.",2024-06-15,2024,2024-06,education

Evaluating Human-AI Collaboration: A Review and Methodological Framework,"The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in working environments with
individuals, known as Human-AI Collaboration (HAIC), has become essential in a
variety of domains, boosting decision-making, efficiency, and innovation.
Despite HAIC's wide potential, evaluating its effectiveness remains challenging
due to the complex interaction of components involved.
  This paper provides a detailed analysis of existing HAIC evaluation
approaches and develops a fresh paradigm for more effectively evaluating these
systems.
  Our framework includes a structured decision tree which assists to select
relevant metrics based on distinct HAIC modes (AI-Centric, Human-Centric, and
Symbiotic). By including both quantitative and qualitative metrics, the
framework seeks to represent HAIC's dynamic and reciprocal nature, enabling the
assessment of its impact and success. This framework's practicality can be
examined by its application in an array of domains, including manufacturing,
healthcare, finance, and education, each of which has unique challenges and
requirements. Our hope is that this study will facilitate further research on
the systematic evaluation of HAIC in real-world applications.",2024-07-09,2024,2024-07,education
"Promoting AI Competencies for Medical Students: A Scoping Review on

intelligence (AI), AI literacy among physicians will become a critical
requirement for ensuring safe and ethical AI-enabled patient care. Despite the
evolving importance of AI in healthcare, the extent to which it has been
adopted into traditional and often-overloaded medical curricula is currently
unknown. In a scoping review of 1,699 articles published between January 2016
and June 2024, we identified 18 studies which propose guiding frameworks, and
11 studies documenting real-world instruction, centered around the integration
of AI into medical education. We found that comprehensive guidelines will
require greater clinical relevance and personalization to suit medical student
interests and career trajectories. Current efforts highlight discrepancies in
the teaching guidelines, emphasizing AI evaluation and ethics over technical
topics such as data science and coding. Additionally, we identified several
challenges associated with integrating AI training into the medical education
program, including a lack of guidelines to define medical students AI literacy,
a perceived lack of proven clinical value, and a scarcity of qualified
instructors. With this knowledge, we propose an AI literacy framework to define
competencies for medical students. To prioritize relevant and personalized AI
education, we categorize literacy into four dimensions: Foundational,
Practical, Experimental, and Ethical, with tailored learning objectives to the
pre-clinical, clinical, and clinical research stages of medical education. This

from real world as training corpus is expensive, the outputs of existing LLMs
in teaching dialogues fall short of human standards. To address this, we design
a Retrieval-augmented Multi-role Multi-expert Collaboration (RAM2C) framework

retrieval-augmented by the above different knowledge bases, into multi-experts
groups with distinct roles to generate the HTS-compliant educational dialogues
dataset. We then fine-tuned the LLMs using this dataset. Empirical evaluations
indicate that RM2C-empowered LLMs excel in Chinese reading teaching, offering
more personalized, and ethically safe teaching response, demonstrating RAM2C's
practicality and high quality. We release the experiments at

"The application of GPT-4 in grading design university students'
  assignment and providing feedback: An exploratory study","This study aims to investigate whether GPT-4 can effectively grade
assignments for design university students and provide useful feedback. In
design education, assignments do not have a single correct answer and often
involve solving an open-ended design problem. This subjective nature of design
projects often leads to grading problems,as grades can vary between different
raters,for instance instructor from engineering background or architecture
background. This study employs an iterative research approach in developing a
Custom GPT with the aim of achieving more reliable results and testing whether
it can provide design students with constructive feedback. The findings
include: First,through several rounds of iterations the inter-reliability
between GPT and human raters reached a level that is generally accepted by
educators. This indicates that by providing accurate prompts to GPT,and
continuously iterating to build a Custom GPT, it can be used to effectively
grade students' design assignments, serving as a reliable complement to human
raters. Second, the intra-reliability of GPT's scoring at different times is
between 0.65 and 0.78. This indicates that, with adequate instructions, a
Custom GPT gives consistent results which is a precondition for grading
students. As consistency and comparability are the two main rules to ensure the
reliability of educational assessment, this study has looked at whether a
Custom GPT can be developed that adheres to these two rules. We finish the

and students to benefit from technological advancements. We surveyed 117
academics from three countries (UK, UAE, and Iraq), and identified that most
academics retain positive opinions regarding AI in education. For example, the
majority of experienced academics do not favour complete bans, and they see the
potential benefits of AI for students, teaching staff, and academic
institutions. Importantly, academics specifically identified the particular
benefits of AI for autonomous assessment (71.79% of respondents agreed).
Therefore, for the first time, we propose a novel AI framework for autonomously
evaluating students' work (e.g., reports, coursework, etc.) and automatically
assigning grades based on their knowledge and in-depth understanding of the
submitted content. The survey results further highlight a significant lack of
awareness of modern AI-based tools (e.g., ChatGPT) among experienced academics,
a gap that must be addressed to uphold educational standards.",2024-10-28,2024,2024-10,education

Tuning Music Education: AI-Powered Personalization in Learning Music,"Recent AI-driven step-function advances in several longstanding problems in
music technology are opening up new avenues to create the next generation of
music education tools. Creating personalized, engaging, and effective learning
experiences are continuously evolving challenges in music education. Here we
present two case studies using such advances in music technology to address
these challenges. In our first case study we showcase an application that uses
Automatic Chord Recognition to generate personalized exercises from audio
tracks, connecting traditional ear training with real-world musical contexts.
In the second case study we prototype adaptive piano method books that use
Automatic Music Transcription to generate exercises at different skill levels
while retaining a close connection to musical interests. These applications
demonstrate how recent AI developments can democratize access to high-quality
music education and promote rich interaction with music in the age of
generative AI. We hope this work inspires other efforts in the community, aimed

"Making Transparency Advocates: An Educational Approach Towards Better
  Algorithmic Transparency in Practice","Concerns about the risks and harms posed by artificial intelligence (AI) have
resulted in significant study into algorithmic transparency, giving rise to a
sub-field known as Explainable AI (XAI). Unfortunately, despite a decade of
development in XAI, an existential challenge remains: progress in research has
not been fully translated into the actual implementation of algorithmic
transparency by organizations. In this work, we test an approach for addressing
the challenge by creating transparency advocates, or motivated individuals
within organizations who drive a ground-up cultural shift towards improved
algorithmic transparency.
  Over several years, we created an open-source educational workshop on
algorithmic transparency and advocacy. We delivered the workshop to
professionals across two separate domains to improve their algorithmic
transparency literacy and willingness to advocate for change. In the weeks
following the workshop, participants applied what they learned, such as
speaking up for algorithmic transparency at an organization-wide AI strategy
meeting. We also make two broader observations: first, advocacy is not a
monolith and can be broken down into different levels. Second, individuals'
willingness for advocacy is affected by their professional field. For example,
news and media professionals may be more likely to advocate for algorithmic
transparency than those working at technology start-ups.",2024-12-19,2024,2024-12,education
"Beyond the Hype: A Comprehensive Review of Current Trends in Generative
  AI Research, Teaching Practices, and Tools","Generative AI (GenAI) is advancing rapidly, and the literature in computing
education is expanding almost as quickly. Initial responses to GenAI tools were
mixed between panic and utopian optimism. Many were fast to point out the
opportunities and challenges of GenAI. Researchers reported that these new
tools are capable of solving most introductory programming tasks and are
causing disruptions throughout the curriculum. These tools can write and
explain code, enhance error messages, create resources for instructors, and
even provide feedback and help for students like a traditional teaching
assistant. In 2024, new research started to emerge on the effects of GenAI
usage in the computing classroom. These new data involve the use of GenAI to
support classroom instruction at scale and to teach students how to code with
GenAI. In support of the former, a new class of tools is emerging that can
provide personalized feedback to students on their programming assignments or
teach both programming and prompting skills at the same time. With the
literature expanding so rapidly, this report aims to summarize and explain what
is happening on the ground in computing classrooms. We provide a systematic
literature review; a survey of educators and industry professionals; and
interviews with educators using GenAI in their courses, educators studying
GenAI, and researchers who create GenAI tools to support computing education.

An architecture for the evaluation of intelligent systems,"One of the main research areas in Artificial Intelligence is the coding of
agents (programs) which are able to learn by themselves in any situation. This
means that agents must be useful for purposes other than those they were
created for, as, for example, playing chess. In this way we try to get closer
to the pristine goal of Artificial Intelligence. One of the problems to decide
whether an agent is really intelligent or not is the measurement of its
intelligence, since there is currently no way to measure it in a reliable way.
The purpose of this project is to create an interpreter that allows for the
execution of several environments, including those which are generated
randomly, so that an agent (a person or a program) can interact with them. Once
the interaction between the agent and the environment is over, the interpreter
will measure the intelligence of the agent according to the actions, states and
rewards the agent has undergone inside the environment during the test. As a
result we will be able to measure agents' intelligence in any possible
environment, and to make comparisons between several agents, in order to
determine which of them is the most intelligent. In order to perform the tests,
the interpreter must be able to randomly generate environments that are really
useful to measure agents' intelligence, since not any randomly generated
environment will serve that purpose.",2011-02-03,2011,2011-02,environment

Markov Localization for Mobile Robots in Dynamic Environments,"Localization, that is the estimation of a robot's location from sensor data,
is a fundamental problem in mobile robotics. This papers presents a version of
Markov localization which provides accurate position estimates and which is
tailored towards dynamic environments. The key idea of Markov localization is
to maintain a probability density over the space of all locations of a robot in
its environment. Our approach represents this space metrically, using a
fine-grained grid to approximate densities. It is able to globally localize the
robot from scratch and to recover from localization failures. It is robust to
approximate models of the environment (such as occupancy grid maps) and noisy
sensors (such as ultrasound sensors). Our approach also includes a filtering
technique which allows a mobile robot to reliably estimate its position even in
densely populated environments in which crowds of people block the robot's
sensors for extended periods of time. The method described here has been

A Model of Inductive Bias Learning,"A major problem in machine learning is that of inductive bias: how to choose
a learner's hypothesis space so that it is large enough to contain a solution
to the problem being learnt, yet small enough to ensure reliable generalization
from reasonably-sized training sets. Typically such bias is supplied by hand
through the skill and insights of experts. In this paper a model for
automatically learning bias is investigated. The central assumption of the
model is that the learner is embedded within an environment of related learning
tasks. Within such an environment the learner can sample from multiple tasks,
and hence it can search for a hypothesis space that contains good solutions to
many of the problems in the environment. Under certain restrictions on the set
of all hypothesis spaces available to the learner, we show that a hypothesis
space that performs well on a sufficiently large number of training tasks will
also perform well when learning novel tasks in the same environment. Explicit
bounds are also derived demonstrating that learning multiple tasks within an
environment of related tasks can potentially give much better generalization
than learning a single task.",2011-06-01,2011,2011-06,environment
Robust Agent Teams via Socially-Attentive Monitoring,"Agents in dynamic multi-agent environments must monitor their peers to
execute individual and group plans. A key open question is how much monitoring
of other agents' states is required to be effective: The Monitoring Selectivity
Problem. We investigate this question in the context of detecting failures in
teams of cooperating agents, via Socially-Attentive Monitoring, which focuses
on monitoring for failures in the social relationships between the agents. We
empirically and analytically explore a family of socially-attentive teamwork
monitoring algorithms in two dynamic, complex, multi-agent domains, under
varying conditions of task distribution and uncertainty. We show that a
centralized scheme using a complex algorithm trades correctness for
completeness and requires monitoring all teammates. In contrast, a simple
distributed teamwork monitoring algorithm results in correct and complete
detection of teamwork failures, despite relying on limited, uncertain
knowledge, and monitoring only key agents in a team. In addition, we report on
the design of a socially-attentive monitoring system and demonstrate its

detected failures, and both on-line and off-line applications.",2011-06-01,2011,2011-06,environment

Accelerating Reinforcement Learning through Implicit Imitation,"Imitation can be viewed as a means of enhancing learning in multiagent
environments. It augments an agent's ability to learn useful behaviors by
making intelligent use of the knowledge implicit in behaviors demonstrated by
cooperative teachers or other more experienced agents. We propose and study a
formal model of implicit imitation that can accelerate reinforcement learning
dramatically in certain cases. Roughly, by observing a mentor, a
reinforcement-learning agent can extract information about its own capabilities
in, and the relative value of, unvisited parts of the state space. We study two
specific instantiations of this model, one in which the learning agent and the
mentor have identical abilities, and one designed to deal with agents and
mentors with different action sets. We illustrate the benefits of implicit
imitation by integrating it with prioritized sweeping, and demonstrating
improved performance and convergence through observation of single and multiple
mentors. Though we make some stringent assumptions regarding observability and
possible interactions, we briefly comment on extensions of the model that relax
these restricitions.",2011-06-03,2011,2011-06,environment

"Reinforcement Learning for Agents with Many Sensors and Actuators Acting
  in Categorizable Environments","In this paper, we confront the problem of applying reinforcement learning to
agents that perceive the environment through many sensors and that can perform
parallel actions using many actuators as is the case in complex autonomous
robots. We argue that reinforcement learning can only be successfully applied
to this case if strong assumptions are made on the characteristics of the
environment in which the learning is performed, so that the relevant sensor
readings and motor commands can be readily identified. The introduction of such
assumptions leads to strongly-biased learning systems that can eventually lose
the generality of traditional reinforcement-learning algorithms. In this line,
we observe that, in realistic situations, the reward received by the robot
depends only on a reduced subset of all the executed actions and that only a
reduced subset of the sensor inputs (possibly different in each situation and
for each action) are relevant to predict the reward. We formalize this property
in the so called 'categorizability assumption' and we present an algorithm that
takes advantage of the categorizability of the environment, allowing a decrease
in the learning time with respect to existing reinforcement-learning
algorithms. Results of the application of the algorithm to a couple of
simulated realistic-robotic problems (landmark-based navigation and the
six-legged robot gait generation) are reported to validate our approach and to
compare it to existing flat and generalization-based reinforcement-learning
approaches.",2011-06-30,2011,2011-06,environment

"Information, Utility & Bounded Rationality","Perfectly rational decision-makers maximize expected utility, but crucially
ignore the resource costs incurred when determining optimal actions. Here we
employ an axiomatic framework for bounded rational decision-making based on a
thermodynamic interpretation of resource costs as information costs. This leads
to a variational ""free utility"" principle akin to thermodynamical free energy
that trades off utility and information costs. We show that bounded optimal
control solutions can be derived from this variational principle, which leads
in general to stochastic policies. Furthermore, we show that risk-sensitive and
robust (minimax) control schemes fall out naturally from this framework if the
environment is considered as a bounded rational and perfectly rational
opponent, respectively. When resource costs are ignored, the maximum expected
utility principle is recovered.",2011-07-28,2011,2011-07,environment

Resource Allocation Among Agents with MDP-Induced Preferences,"Allocating scarce resources among agents to maximize global utility is, in
general, computationally challenging. We focus on problems where resources
enable agents to execute actions in stochastic environments, modeled as Markov
decision processes (MDPs), such that the value of a resource bundle is defined
as the expected value of the optimal MDP policy realizable given these
resources. We present an algorithm that simultaneously solves the
resource-allocation and the policy-optimization problems. This allows us to
avoid explicitly representing utilities over exponentially many resource
bundles, leading to drastic (often exponential) reductions in computational
complexity. We then use this algorithm in the context of self-interested agents
to design a combinatorial auction for allocating resources. We empirically
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by showing that it can, in
minutes, optimally solve problems for which a straightforward combinatorial
resource-allocation technique would require the agents to enumerate up to 2^100
resource bundles and the auctioneer to solve an NP-complete problem with an

  We examine here the question: Why do humans dispose of the diffusive

One Decade of Universal Artificial Intelligence,"The first decade of this century has seen the nascency of the first
mathematical theory of general artificial intelligence. This theory of
Universal Artificial Intelligence (UAI) has made significant contributions to
many theoretical, philosophical, and practical AI questions. In a series of
papers culminating in book (Hutter, 2005), an exciting sound and complete
mathematical model for a super intelligent agent (AIXI) has been developed and
rigorously analyzed. While nowadays most AI researchers avoid discussing
intelligence, the award-winning PhD thesis (Legg, 2008) provided the
philosophical embedding and investigated the UAI-based universal measure of
rational intelligence, which is formal, objective and non-anthropocentric.
Recently, effective approximations of AIXI have been derived and experimentally
investigated in JAIR paper (Veness et al. 2011). This practical breakthrough
has resulted in some impressive applications, finally muting earlier critique
that UAI is only a theory. For the first time, without providing any domain
knowledge, the same agent is able to self-adapt to a diverse range of
interactive environments. For instance, AIXI is able to learn from scratch to
play TicTacToe, Pacman, Kuhn Poker, and other games by trial and error, without
even providing the rules of the games.
  These achievements give new hope that the grand goal of Artificial General
Intelligence is not elusive.
  This article provides an informal overview of UAI in context. It attempts to
gently introduce a very theoretical, formal, and mathematical subject, and
discusses philosophical and technical ingredients, traits of intelligence, some
social questions, and the past and future of UAI.",2012-02-28,2012,2012-02,environment
Truthful Feedback for Sanctioning Reputation Mechanisms,"For product rating environments, similar to that of Amazon Reviews, it has
been shown that the truthful elicitation of feedback is possible through
mechanisms which pay buyer reports contingent on the reports of other buyers.
We study whether similar mechanisms can be designed for reputation mechanisms
at online auction sites where the buyers' experiences are partially determined
by a strategic seller. We show that this is impossible for the basic setting.
However, introducing a small prior belief that the seller is a cooperative
commitment player leads to a payment scheme with a truthful perfect Bayesian
equilibrium.",2012-03-15,2012,2012-03,environment
Variance-Based Rewards for Approximate Bayesian Reinforcement Learning,"The explore{exploit dilemma is one of the central challenges in Reinforcement
Learning (RL). Bayesian RL solves the dilemma by providing the agent with
information in the form of a prior distribution over environments; however,
full Bayesian planning is intractable. Planning with the mean MDP is a common
myopic approximation of Bayesian planning. We derive a novel reward bonus that
is a function of the posterior distribution over environments, which, when
added to the reward in planning with the mean MDP, results in an agent which
explores efficiently and effectively. Although our method is similar to
existing methods when given an uninformative or unstructured prior, unlike
existing methods, our method can exploit structured priors. We prove that our
method results in a polynomial sample complexity and empirically demonstrate
its advantages in a structured exploration task.",2012-03-15,2012,2012-03,environment
Bayesian Inference in Monte-Carlo Tree Search,"Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) methods are drawing great interest after
yielding breakthrough results in computer Go. This paper proposes a Bayesian
approach to MCTS that is inspired by distributionfree approaches such as UCT
[13], yet significantly differs in important respects. The Bayesian framework
allows potentially much more accurate (Bayes-optimal) estimation of node values
and node uncertainties from a limited number of simulation trials. We further
propose propagating inference in the tree via fast analytic Gaussian
approximation methods: this can make the overhead of Bayesian inference
manageable in domains such as Go, while preserving high accuracy of
expected-value estimates. We find substantial empirical outperformance of UCT
in an idealized bandit-tree test environment, where we can obtain valuable
insights by comparing with known ground truth. Additionally we rigorously prove
on-policy and off-policy convergence of the proposed methods.",2012-03-15,2012,2012-03,environment
"When majority voting fails: Comparing quality assurance methods for
  noisy human computation environment","Quality assurance remains a key topic in human computation research. Prior
work indicates that majority voting is effective for low difficulty tasks, but
has limitations for harder tasks. This paper explores two methods of addressing
this problem: tournament selection and elimination selection, which exploit 2-,
3- and 4-way comparisons between different answers to human computation tasks.
Our experimental results and statistical analyses show that both methods
produce the correct answer in noisy human computation environment more often
than majority voting. Furthermore, we find that the use of 4-way comparisons
can significantly reduce the cost of quality assurance relative to the use of
2-way comparisons.",2012-04-16,2012,2012-04,environment
Generating Optimal Plans in Highly-Dynamic Domains,"Generating optimal plans in highly dynamic environments is challenging. Plans
are predicated on an assumed initial state, but this state can change
unexpectedly during plan generation, potentially invalidating the planning
effort. In this paper we make three contributions: (1) We propose a novel
algorithm for generating optimal plans in settings where frequent, unexpected
events interfere with planning. It is able to quickly distinguish relevant from
irrelevant state changes, and to update the existing planning search tree if
necessary. (2) We argue for a new criterion for evaluating plan adaptation
techniques: the relative running time compared to the ""size"" of changes. This
is significant since during recovery more changes may occur that need to be
recovered from subsequently, and in order for this process of repeated recovery
to terminate, recovery time has to converge. (3) We show empirically that our
approach can converge and find optimal plans in environments that would
ordinarily defy planning due to their high dynamics.",2012-05-09,2012,2012-05,environment
"A Sampling-Based Approach to Computing Equilibria in Succinct
  Extensive-Form Games","A central task of artificial intelligence is the design of artificial agents
that act towards specified goals in partially observed environments. Since such
environments frequently include interaction over time with other agents with
their own goals, reasoning about such interaction relies on sequential
game-theoretic models such as extensive-form games or some of their succinct
representations such as multi-agent influence diagrams. The current algorithms
for calculating equilibria either work with inefficient representations,
possibly doubly exponential inthe number of time steps, or place strong
assumptions on the game structure. In this paper,we propose a sampling-based
approach, which calculates extensive-form correlated equilibria with small
representations without placing such strong assumptions. Thus, it is practical
in situations where the previous approaches would fail. In addition, our
algorithm allows control over characteristics of the target equilibrium, e.g.,
we can ask for an equilibrium with high social welfare. Our approach is based
on a multiplicativeweight update algorithm analogous to AdaBoost, and Markov
chain Monte Carlo sampling. We prove convergence guarantees and explore the
utility of our approach on several moderately sized multi-player games.",2012-05-09,2012,2012-05,environment
Improving Gradient Estimation by Incorporating Sensor Data,"An efficient policy search algorithm should estimate the local gradient of
the objective function, with respect to the policy parameters, from as few
trials as possible. Whereas most policy search methods estimate this gradient
by observing the rewards obtained during policy trials, we show, both
theoretically and empirically, that taking into account the sensor data as well
gives better gradient estimates and hence faster learning. The reason is that
rewards obtained during policy execution vary from trial to trial due to noise
in the environment; sensor data, which correlates with the noise, can be used
to partially correct for this variation, resulting in an estimatorwith lower
variance.",2012-06-13,2012,2012-06,environment
CT-NOR: Representing and Reasoning About Events in Continuous Time,"We present a generative model for representing and reasoning about the

of the model from timestamp observations, and then use hypothesis testing to
discover dependencies between the events and changes in behavior for monitoring
and diagnosis. After introducing the model, we present an EM algorithm for
fitting the parameters and then present the hypothesis testing approach for
both dependence discovery and change-point detection. We validate the approach
for both tasks using real data from a trace of network events at Microsoft
Research Cambridge. Finally, we formalize the relationship between the proposed

Probabilistic Models for Anomaly Detection in Remote Sensor Data Streams,"Remote sensors are becoming the standard for observing and recording
ecological data in the field. Such sensors can record data at fine temporal
resolutions, and they can operate under extreme conditions prohibitive to human
access. Unfortunately, sensor data streams exhibit many kinds of errors ranging
from corrupt communications to partial or total sensor failures. This means
that the raw data stream must be cleaned before it can be used by domain
scientists. In our application environment|the H.J. Andrews Experimental
Forest|this data cleaning is performed manually. This paper introduces a
Dynamic Bayesian Network model for analyzing sensor observations and
distinguishing sensor failures from valid data for the case of air temperature
measured at 15 minute time resolution. The model combines an accurate
distribution of long-term and short-term temperature variations with a single
generalized fault model. Experiments with historical data show that the
precision and recall of the method is comparable to that of the domain expert.
The system is currently being deployed to perform real-time automated data

"Predicting the behavior of interacting humans by fusing data from
  multiple sources","Multi-fidelity methods combine inexpensive low-fidelity simulations with
costly but high-fidelity simulations to produce an accurate model of a system

systems and have been applied to engineering problems such as wing-design
optimization. During human-in-the-loop experimentation, it has become
increasingly common to use online platforms, like Mechanical Turk, to run
low-fidelity experiments to gather human performance data in an efficient
manner. One concern with these experiments is that the results obtained from
the online environment generalize poorly to the actual domain of interest. To
address this limitation, we extend traditional multi-fidelity approaches to
allow us to combine fewer data points from high-fidelity human-in-the-loop
experiments with plentiful but less accurate data from low-fidelity experiments
to produce accurate models of how humans interact. We present both model-based

observing an expert demonstrating the task in a partially observable
environment when the model of the environment is uncertain. This setting is
useful in applications where the explicit modeling of the environment is
difficult, such as a dialogue system. We show that we can extract information
about the environment model by inferring action selection process behind the
demonstration, under the assumption that the expert is choosing optimal actions
based on knowledge of the true model of the target environment. Proposed
algorithms can achieve more accurate estimates of POMDP parameters and better

"Optimal Coordinated Planning Amongst Self-Interested Agents with Private
  State","Consider a multi-agent system in a dynamic and uncertain environment. Each
agent's local decision problem is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP)
and agents must coordinate on a joint action in each period, which provides a
reward to each agent and causes local state transitions. A social planner knows
the model of every agent's MDP and wants to implement the optimal joint policy,
but agents are self-interested and have private local state. We provide an
incentive-compatible mechanism for eliciting state information that achieves
the optimal joint plan in a Markov perfect equilibrium of the induced
stochastic game. In the special case in which local problems are Markov chains
and agents compete to take a single action in each period, we leverage Gittins
allocation indices to provide an efficient factored algorithm and distribute
computation of the optimal policy among the agents. Distributed, optimal
coordinated learning in a multi-agent variant of the multi-armed bandit problem
is obtained as a special case.",2012-06-27,2012,2012-06,environment
"A compact, hierarchical Q-function decomposition","Previous work in hierarchical reinforcement learning has faced a dilemma:
either ignore the values of different possible exit states from a subroutine,
thereby risking suboptimal behavior, or represent those values explicitly
thereby incurring a possibly large representation cost because exit values
refer to nonlocal aspects of the world (i.e., all subsequent rewards). This
paper shows that, in many cases, one can avoid both of these problems. The
solution is based on recursively decomposing the exit value function in terms
of Q-functions at higher levels of the hierarchy. This leads to an intuitively
appealing runtime architecture in which a parent subroutine passes to its child
a value function on the exit states and the child reasons about how its choices
affect the exit value. We also identify structural conditions on the value
function and transition distributions that allow much more concise
representations of exit state distributions, leading to further state
abstraction. In essence, the only variables whose exit values need be
considered are those that the parent cares about and the child affects. We
demonstrate the utility of our algorithms on a series of increasingly complex

Robotic Mapping with Polygonal Random Fields,"Two types of probabilistic maps are popular in the mobile robotics
literature: occupancy grids and geometric maps. Occupancy grids have the
advantages of simplicity and speed, but they represent only a restricted class
of maps and they make incorrect independence assumptions. On the other hand,
current geometric approaches, which characterize the environment by features
such as line segments, can represent complex environments compactly. However,
they do not reason explicitly about occupancy, a necessity for motion planning;
and, they lack a complete probability model over environmental structures. In
this paper we present a probabilistic mapping technique based on polygonal
random fields (PRF), which combines the advantages of both approaches. Our
approach explicitly represents occupancy using a geometric representation, and
it is based upon a consistent probability distribution over environments which
avoids the incorrect independence assumptions made by occupancy grids. We show
how sampling techniques for PRFs can be applied to localized laser and sonar

Counterexample-guided Planning,"Planning in adversarial and uncertain environments can be modeled as the
problem of devising strategies in stochastic perfect information games. These
games are generalizations of Markov decision processes (MDPs): there are two
(adversarial) players, and a source of randomness. The main practical obstacle
to computing winning strategies in such games is the size of the state space.
In practice therefore, one typically works with abstractions of the model. The
diffculty is to come up with an abstraction that is neither too coarse to
remove all winning strategies (plans), nor too fine to be intractable. In
verification, the paradigm of counterexample-guided abstraction refinement has
been successful to construct useful but parsimonious abstractions
automatically. We extend this paradigm to probabilistic models (namely, perfect
information games and, as a special case, MDPs). This allows us to apply the
counterexample-guided abstraction paradigm to the AI planning problem. As
special cases, we get planning algorithms for MDPs and deterministic systems
that automatically construct system abstractions.",2012-07-04,2012,2012-07,environment

used for activity-class discovery in an unsupervised manner. We show how
modeling an activity as a variable length Markov process, can be used to
discover recurrent event-motifs to characterize the discovered

This is a difficult decision problem, requiring the probability of being

sequences of views observed by a robot navigating through the environment. A
Dirichlet prior over structural models is learned from previously explored

shape parameters at both levels of the hierarchy, using local occupancy grid
maps for representing shape. Additionally, we develop a Bayesian model
selection algorithm that enables the robot to estimate the total number of
objects and object templates in the environment. Experimental results using a

"Artificial Intelligence Framework for Simulating Clinical
  Decision-Making: A Markov Decision Process Approach","In the modern healthcare system, rapidly expanding costs/complexity, the
growing myriad of treatment options, and exploding information streams that
often do not effectively reach the front lines hinder the ability to choose
optimal treatment decisions over time. The goal in this paper is to develop a
general purpose (non-disease-specific) computational/artificial intelligence
(AI) framework to address these challenges. This serves two potential
functions: 1) a simulation environment for exploring various healthcare
policies, payment methodologies, etc., and 2) the basis for clinical artificial
intelligence - an AI that can think like a doctor. This approach combines
Markov decision processes and dynamic decision networks to learn from clinical
data and develop complex plans via simulation of alternative sequential
decision paths while capturing the sometimes conflicting, sometimes synergistic
interactions of various components in the healthcare system. It can operate in
partially observable environments (in the case of missing observations or data)
by maintaining belief states about patient health status and functions as an
online agent that plans and re-plans. This framework was evaluated using real
patient data from an electronic health record. Such an AI framework easily
outperforms the current treatment-as-usual (TAU) case-rate/fee-for-service
models of healthcare (Cost per Unit Change: $189 vs. $497) while obtaining a
30-35% increase in patient outcomes. Tweaking certain model parameters further
enhances this advantage, obtaining roughly 50% more improvement for roughly
half the costs. Given careful design and problem formulation, an AI simulation

robustness to reduction in the amount of available data. We present new
initialization heuristics which can be used even when the data suffers from

Multi-objects association in perception of dynamical situation,"In current perception systems applied to the rebuilding of the environment

temporal evolution and secondly to increase the reliability of environment
perception. We propose in this communication the development of a multi-objects
association algorithm with ambiguity removal entering into the design of such a
dynamic perception system for intelligent vehicles. This algorithm uses the
belief theory and data modelling with fuzzy mathematics in order to be able to
handle inaccurate as well as uncertain information due to imperfect sensors.
These theories also allow the fusion of numerical as well as symbolic data. We
develop in this article the problem of matching between known and perceived
objects. This makes it possible to update a dynamic environment map for a
vehicle. The belief theory will enable us to quantify the belief in the
association of each perceived object with each known object. Conflicts can
appear in the case of object appearance or disappearance, or in the case of a
confused situation or bad perception. These conflicts are removed or solved
using an assignment algorithm, giving a solution called the "" best "" and so
ensuring the tracking of some objects present in our environment.",2013-01-23,2013,2013-01,environment
Model-Based Bayesian Exploration,"Reinforcement learning systems are often concerned with balancing exploration
of untested actions against exploitation of actions that are known to be good.
The benefit of exploration can be estimated using the classical notion of Value
of Information - the expected improvement in future decision quality arising
from the information acquired by exploration. Estimating this quantity requires
an assessment of the agent's uncertainty about its current value estimates for
states. In this paper we investigate ways of representing and reasoning about
this uncertainty in algorithms where the system attempts to learn a model of
its environment. We explicitly represent uncertainty about the parameters of
the model and build probability distributions over Q-values based on these.
These distributions are used to compute a myopic approximation to the value of
information for each action and hence to select the action that best balances
exploration and exploitation.",2013-01-23,2013,2013-01,environment
Learning Finite-State Controllers for Partially Observable Environments,"Reactive (memoryless) policies are sufficient in completely observable Markov
decision processes (MDPs), but some kind of memory is usually necessary for
optimal control of a partially observable MDP. Policies with finite memory can
be represented as finite-state automata. In this paper, we extend Baird and
Moore's VAPS algorithm to the problem of learning general finite-state
automata. Because it performs stochastic gradient descent, this algorithm can
be shown to converge to a locally optimal finite-state controller. We provide
the details of the algorithm and then consider the question of under what
conditions stochastic gradient descent will outperform exact gradient descent.
We conclude with empirical results comparing the performance of stochastic and
exact gradient descent, and showing the ability of our algorithm to extract the
useful information contained in the sequence of past observations to compensate
for the lack of observability at each time-step.",2013-01-23,2013,2013-01,environment
Subjective Reality and Strong Artificial Intelligence,"The main prospective aim of modern research related to Artificial
Intelligence is the creation of technical systems that implement the idea of
Strong Intelligence. According our point of view the path to the development of
such systems comes through the research in the field related to perceptions.
Here we formulate the model of the perception of external world which may be
used for the description of perceptual activity of intelligent beings. We
consider a number of issues related to the development of the set of patterns
which will be used by the intelligent system when interacting with environment.
The key idea of the presented perception model is the idea of subjective
reality. The principle of the relativity of perceived world is formulated. It
is shown that this principle is the immediate consequence of the idea of
subjective reality. In this paper we show how the methodology of subjective
reality may be used for the creation of different types of Strong AI systems.",2013-01-27,2013,2013-01,environment
Dealing with Uncertainty on the Initial State of a Petri Net,"This paper proposes a method to find the actual state of a complex dynamic
system from information coming from the sensors on the system himself, or on
its environment. The nominal evolution of the system is a priori known and can
be modeled (by an expert, for example), by different methods. In this paper,
the Petri nets have been chosen. Contrary to the usual use of the Petri nets,
the initial state of the system is unknown. So a degree of belief is bound to
each places, or set of places. The theory used to model this uncertainty is the
Dempster-Shafer's one which is well adapted to this type of problems. From the
given Petri net characterizing the nominal evolution of the dynamic system, and
from the observation inputs, the proposed method allows to determine according
to the reliability of the model and the inputs, the state of the system at any
time.",2013-01-30,2013,2013-01,environment
On Stable Multi-Agent Behavior in Face of Uncertainty,"A stable joint plan should guarantee the achievement of a designer's goal in

Bayes Networks for Sonar Sensor Fusion,"Wide-angle sonar mapping of the environment by mobile robot is nontrivial due
to several sources of uncertainty: dropouts due to ""specular"" reflections,
obstacle location uncertainty due to the wide beam, and distance measurement
error. Earlier papers address the latter problems, but dropouts remain a
problem in many environments. We present an approach that lifts the
overoptimistic independence assumption used in earlier work, and use Bayes nets
to represent the dependencies between objects of the model. Objects of the
model consist of readings, and of regions in which ""quasi location invariance""
of the (possible) obstacles exists, with respect to the readings. Simulation
supports the method's feasibility. The model is readily extensible to allow for
prior distributions, as well as other types of sensing operations.",2013-02-06,2013,2013-02,environment
Complexity distribution of agent policies,"We analyse the complexity of environments according to the policies that need

policy complexity and analysed through several diagrams and indicators. The
notion of environment response curve is also introduced, by inverting the
performance results into an ability scale. We apply all these concepts,
diagrams and indicators to a minimalistic environment class, agent-populated
elementary cellular automata, showing how the difficulty, discriminating power
and ranges (previous to normalisation) may vary for several environments.",2013-02-08,2013,2013-02,environment
Plan Development using Local Probabilistic Models,"Approximate models of world state transitions are necessary when building
plans for complex systems operating in dynamic environments. External event
probabilities can depend on state feature values as well as time spent in that
particular state. We assign temporally -dependent probability functions to
state transitions. These functions are used to locally compute state
probabilities, which are then used to select highly probable goal paths and
eliminate improbable states. This probabilistic model has been implemented in
the Cooperative Intelligent Real-time Control Architecture (CIRCA), which
combines an AI planner with a separate real-time system such that plans are
developed, scheduled, and executed with real-time guarantees. We present flight
simulation tests that demonstrate how our probabilistic model may improve CIRCA
performance.",2013-02-13,2013,2013-02,environment
Probabilistic Exploration in Planning while Learning,"Sequential decision tasks with incomplete information are characterized by
the exploration problem; namely the trade-off between further exploration for
learning more about the environment and immediate exploitation of the accrued
information for decision-making. Within artificial intelligence, there has been
an increasing interest in studying planning-while-learning algorithms for these
decision tasks. In this paper we focus on the exploration problem in
reinforcement learning and Q-learning in particular. The existing exploration
strategies for Q-learning are of a heuristic nature and they exhibit limited
scaleability in tasks with large (or infinite) state and action spaces.
Efficient experimentation is needed for resolving uncertainties when possible
plans are compared (i.e. exploration). The experimentation should be sufficient
for selecting with statistical significance a locally optimal plan (i.e.
exploitation). For this purpose, we develop a probabilistic hill-climbing
algorithm that uses a statistical selection procedure to decide how much
exploration is needed for selecting a plan which is, with arbitrarily high
probability, arbitrarily close to a locally optimal one. Due to its generality
the algorithm can be employed for the exploration strategy of robust
Q-learning. An experiment on a relatively complex control task shows that the
proposed exploration strategy performs better than a typical exploration
strategy.",2013-02-20,2013,2013-02,environment
"A Structured, Probabilistic Representation of Action","When agents devise plans for execution in the real world, they face two
important forms of uncertainty: they can never have complete knowledge about
the state of the world, and they do not have complete control, as the effects
of their actions are uncertain. While most classical planning methods avoid
explicit uncertainty reasoning, we believe that uncertainty should be
explicitly represented and reasoned about. We develop a probabilistic
representation for states and actions, based on belief networks. We define
conditional belief nets (CBNs) to capture the probabilistic dependency of the
effects of an action upon the state of the world. We also use a CBN to
represent the intrinsic relationships among entities in the environment, which
persist from state to state. We present a simple projection algorithm to
construct the belief network of the state succeeding an action, using the
environment CBN model to infer indirect effects. We discuss how the qualitative
aspects of belief networks and CBNs make them appropriate for the various
stages of the problem solving process, from model construction to the design of
planning algorithms.",2013-02-27,2013,2013-02,environment
Operator Selection While Planning Under Uncertainty,"This paper describes the best first search strategy used by U-Plan (Mansell
1993a), a planning system that constructs quantitatively ranked plans given an
incomplete description of an uncertain environment. U-Plan uses uncertain and
incomplete evidence de scribing the environment, characterizes it using a
Dempster-Shafer interval, and generates a set of possible world states. Plan
construction takes place in an abstraction hierarchy where strategic decisions
are made before tactical decisions. Search through this abstraction hierarchy
is guided by a quantitative measure (expected fulfillment) based on decision
theory. The search strategy is best first with the provision to update expected
fulfillment and review previous decisions in the light of planning
developments. U-Plan generates multiple plans for multiple possible worlds, and
attempts to use existing plans for new world situations. A super-plan is then
constructed, based on merging the set of plans and appropriately timed
knowledge acquisition operators, which are used to decide between plan
alternatives during plan execution.",2013-02-27,2013,2013-02,environment
Robust Planning in Uncertain Environments,"This paper describes a novel approach to planning which takes advantage of
decision theory to greatly improve robustness in an uncertain environment. We
present an algorithm which computes conditional plans of maximum expected
utility. This algorithm relies on a representation of the search space as an
AND/OR tree and employs a depth-limit to control computation costs. A numeric
robustness factor, which parameterizes the utility function, allows the user to
modulate the degree of risk-aversion employed by the planner. Via a look-ahead
search, the planning algorithm seeks to find an optimal plan using expected
utility as its optimization criterion. We present experimental results obtained
by applying our algorithm to a non-deterministic extension of the blocks world
domain. Our results demonstrate that the robustness factor governs the degree
of risk embodied in the conditional plans computed by our algorithm.",2013-02-27,2013,2013-02,environment
Learning in Multi-level Stochastic games with Delayed Information,"Distributed decision-makers are modeled as players in a game with two levels.
High level decisions concern the game environment and determine the willingness
of the players to form a coalition (or group). Low level decisions involve the
actions to be implemented within the chosen environment. Coalition and action
strategies are determined by probability distributions, which are updated using
learning automata schemes. The payoffs are also probabilistic and there is
uncertainty in the state vector since information is delayed. The goal is to
reach equilibrium in both levels of decision making; the results show the
conditions for instability, based on the age of information.",2013-02-27,2013,2013-02,environment
The Automated Mapping of Plans for Plan Recognition,"To coordinate with other agents in its environment, an agent needs models of
what the other agents are trying to do. When communication is impossible or
expensive, this information must be acquired indirectly via plan recognition.
Typical approaches to plan recognition start with a specification of the
possible plans the other agents may be following, and develop special
techniques for discriminating among the possibilities. Perhaps more desirable
would be a uniform procedure for mapping plans to general structures supporting
inference based on uncertain and incomplete observations. In this paper, we
describe a set of methods for converting plans represented in a flexible
procedural language to observation models represented as probabilistic belief
networks.",2013-02-27,2013,2013-02,environment
Syntax-based Default Reasoning as Probabilistic Model-based Diagnosis,"We view the syntax-based approaches to default reasoning as a model-based
diagnosis problem, where each source giving a piece of information is
considered as a component. It is formalized in the ATMS framework (each source
corresponds to an assumption). We assume then that all sources are independent
and ""fail"" with a very small probability. This leads to a probability
assignment on the set of candidates, or equivalently on the set of consistent
environments. This probability assignment induces a Dempster-Shafer belief
function which measures the probability that a proposition can be deduced from
the evidence. This belief function can be used in several different ways to
define a non-monotonic consequence relation. We study and compare these
consequence relations. The -case of prioritized knowledge bases is briefly
considered.",2013-02-27,2013,2013-02,environment

A Method for Planning Given Uncertain and Incomplete Information,"This paper describes ongoing research into planning in an uncertain
environment. In particular, it introduces U-Plan, a planning system that
constructs quantitatively ranked plans given an incomplete description of the
state of the world. U-Plan uses a DempsterShafer interval to characterise
uncertain and incomplete information about the state of the world. The planner
takes as input what is known about the world, and constructs a number of
possible initial states with representations at different abstraction levels. A
plan is constructed for the initial state with the greatest support, and this
plan is tested to see if it will work for other possible initial states. All,
part, or none of the existing plans may be used in the generation of the plans
for the remaining possible worlds. Planning takes place in an abstraction
hierarchy where strategic decisions are made before tactical decisions. A
super-plan is then constructed, based on merging the set of plans and the
appropriately timed acquisition of essential knowledge, which is used to decide
between plan alternatives. U-Plan usually produces a super-plan in less time
than a classical planner would take to produce a set of plans, one for each
possible world.",2013-03-06,2013,2013-03,environment
Sensor Validation Using Dynamic Belief Networks,"The trajectory of a robot is monitored in a restricted dynamic environment

conventional quantitative filter techniques. Sensor observations are added to
the basic DBN in the form of specific evidence. However, sensor data is often
partially or totally incorrect. We show how the basic DBN, which infers only an
impossible combination of evidence, may be modified to handle specific types of
incorrect data which may occur in the domain. We then present an extension to
the DBN, the addition of an invalidating node, which models the status of the
sensor as working or defective. This node provides a qualitative explanation of
inconsistent data: it is caused by a defective sensor. The connection of
successive instances of the invalidating node models the status of a sensor
over time, allowing the DBN to handle both persistent and intermittent faults.",2013-03-13,2013,2013-03,environment
High Level Path Planning with Uncertainty,"For high level path planning, environments are usually modeled as distance

new tool, called U-yraph, is proposed for environment modeling. A U-graph is an
extension of distance graphs with the ability to handle a kind of uncertainty.
By modeling an uncertain environment as a U-graph, and a navigation problem as
a Markovian decision process, we can precisely define a new optimality
criterion for navigation plans, and more importantly, we can come up with a

ambiguous features are extracted which have multiple possible aggregations
providing evidential support for the presence of multiple hypothesis of objects
and terrain, which in turn aggregate in multiple ways to provide partial

Using standard methods drawn from the theory of computational complexity,
workers in the field have shown that the problem of probabilistic inference in

A Decision-Theoretic Model for Using Scientific Data,"Many Artificial Intelligence systems depend on the agent's updating its
beliefs about the world on the basis of experience. Experiments constitute one
type of experience, so scientific methodology offers a natural environment for
examining the issues attendant to using this class of evidence. This paper
presents a framework which structures the process of using scientific data from
research reports for the purpose of making decisions, using decision analysis
as the basis for the structure and using medical research as the general
scientific domain. The structure extends the basic influence diagram for
updating belief in an object domain parameter of interest by expanding the
parameter into four parts: those of the patient, the population, the study
sample, and the effective study sample. The structure uses biases to perform
the transformation of one parameter into another, so that, for instance,
selection biases, in concert with the population parameter, yield the study
sample parameter. The influence diagram structure provides decision theoretic
justification for practices of good clinical research such as randomized
assignment and blindfolding of care providers. The model covers most research
designs used in medicine: case-control studies, cohort studies, and controlled
clinical trials, and provides an architecture to separate clearly between
statistical knowledge and domain knowledge. The proposed general model can be
the basis for clinical epidemiological advisory systems, when coupled with
heuristic pruning of irrelevant biases; of statistical workstations, when the
computational machinery for calculation of posterior distributions is added;
and of meta-analytic reviews, when multiple studies may impact on a single
population parameter.",2013-03-27,2013,2013-03,environment

solving and reflective control of reasoning under uncertainty in terms of two
fundamental elements: l) a set of decision-theoretic models for selecting among
alternative problem-solving methods and 2) a general computational architecture
for resource-bounded problem solving. The decisiontheoretic models provide a
set of principles for choosing among alternative problem-solving methods based
on their relative costs and benefits, where benefits are characterized in terms
of the value of information provided by the output of a reasoning activity. The
output may be an estimate of some uncertain quantity or a recommendation for
action. The computational architecture, called Schemer-ll, provides for
interleaving of and communication among various problem-solving subsystems.
These subsystems provide alternative approaches to information gathering,
belief refinement, solution construction, and solution execution. In
particular, the architecture provides a mechanism for interrupting the
subsystems in response to critical events. We provide a decision theoretic

independence and modeling assumptions do not hold. As a result, FDM does not
allow the other agent's behavior to be generalized across different states nor
specified using prior domain knowledge. To overcome these practical limitations
of FDM, we propose a generalization of BRL to integrate the general class of

solving subsequent tasks more efficiently. We study this problem on an example
of combinatory logic as the very simple Turing-complete reference machine,
which enables modifying program representations by introducing different sets
of primitive combinators. Genetic programming system is used to search for
combinator expressions, which are easily decomposed into sub-expressions being
recombined in crossover. Our experiments show that low-complexity induction or
prediction tasks can be solved by the developed system (much more efficiently
than using brute force); useful combinators can be revealed and included into
the representation simplifying more difficult tasks. However, optimal sets of
combinators depend on the specific task, so the reference machine should be
adaptively chosen in coordination with the search engine.",2013-06-01,2013,2013-06,environment
Direct Uncertainty Estimation in Reinforcement Learning,"Optimal probabilistic approach in reinforcement learning is computationally
infeasible. Its simplification consisting in neglecting difference between true
environment and its model estimated using limited number of observations causes
exploration vs exploitation problem. Uncertainty can be expressed in terms of a
probability distribution over the space of environment models, and this
uncertainty can be propagated to the action-value function via Bellman
iterations, which are computationally insufficiently efficient though. We
consider possibility of directly measuring uncertainty of the action-value
function, and analyze sufficiency of this facilitated approach.",2013-06-06,2013,2013-06,environment

"Linear combination of one-step predictive information with an external
  reward in an episodic policy gradient setting: a critical analysis","One of the main challenges in the field of embodied artificial intelligence
is the open-ended autonomous learning of complex behaviours. Our approach is to
use task-independent, information-driven intrinsic motivation(s) to support
task-dependent learning. The work presented here is a preliminary step in which
we investigate the predictive information (the mutual information of the past
and future of the sensor stream) as an intrinsic drive, ideally supporting any
kind of task acquisition. Previous experiments have shown that the predictive
information (PI) is a good candidate to support autonomous, open-ended learning
of complex behaviours, because a maximisation of the PI corresponds to an
exploration of morphology- and environment-dependent behavioural regularities.
The idea is that these regularities can then be exploited in order to solve any
given task. Three different experiments are presented and their results lead to
the conclusion that the linear combination of the one-step PI with an external
reward function is not generally recommended in an episodic policy gradient
setting. Only for hard tasks a great speed-up can be achieved at the cost of an
asymptotic performance lost.",2013-09-26,2013,2013-09,environment

"A Rigorously Bayesian Beam Model and an Adaptive Full Scan Model for
  Range Finders in Dynamic Environments","This paper proposes and experimentally validates a Bayesian network model of
a range finder adapted to dynamic environments. All modeling assumptions are
rigorously explained, and all model parameters have a physical interpretation.
This approach results in a transparent and intuitive model. With respect to the
state of the art beam model this paper: (i) proposes a different functional
form for the probability of range measurements caused by unmodeled objects,
(ii) intuitively explains the discontinuity encountered in te state of the art
beam model, and (iii) reduces the number of model parameters, while maintaining
the same representational power for experimental data. The proposed beam model
is called RBBM, short for Rigorously Bayesian Beam Model. A maximum likelihood
and a variational Bayesian estimator (both based on expectation-maximization)
are proposed to learn the model parameters.
  Furthermore, the RBBM is extended to a full scan model in two steps: first,
to a full scan model for static environments and next, to a full scan model for
general, dynamic environments. The full scan model accounts for the dependency
between beams and adapts to the local sample density when using a particle
filter. In contrast to Gaussian-based state of the art models, the proposed
full scan model uses a sample-based approximation. This sample-based
approximation enables handling dynamic environments and capturing
multi-modality, which occurs even in simple static environments.",2014-01-15,2014,2014-01,environment
Online Planning Algorithms for POMDPs,"Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) provide a rich
framework for sequential decision-making under uncertainty in stochastic
domains. However, solving a POMDP is often intractable except for small
problems due to their complexity. Here, we focus on online approaches that
alleviate the computational complexity by computing good local policies at each
decision step during the execution. Online algorithms generally consist of a
lookahead search to find the best action to execute at each time step in an
environment. Our objectives here are to survey the various existing online
POMDP methods, analyze their properties and discuss their advantages and
disadvantages; and to thoroughly evaluate these online approaches in different
environments under various metrics (return, error bound reduction, lower bound
improvement). Our experimental results indicate that state-of-the-art online
heuristic search methods can handle large POMDP domains efficiently.",2014-01-15,2014,2014-01,environment
Computational Logic Foundations of KGP Agents,"This paper presents the computational logic foundations of a model of agency

can exhibit both proactive and reactive behaviour allowing them to function in
dynamic environments by adjusting their goals and plans when changes happen in
such environments. KGP provides a highly modular agent architecture that
integrates a collection of reasoning and physical capabilities, synthesised
within transitions that update the agents state in response to reasoning,
sensing and acting. Transitions are orchestrated by cycle theories that specify
the order in which transitions are executed while taking into account the
dynamic context and agent preferences, as well as selection operators for
providing inputs to transitions.",2014-01-15,2014,2014-01,environment
"Learning to Make Predictions In Partially Observable Environments
  Without a Generative Model","When faced with the problem of learning a model of a high-dimensional
environment, a common approach is to limit the model to make only a restricted
set of predictions, thereby simplifying the learning problem. These partial
models may be directly useful for making decisions or may be combined together
to form a more complete, structured model. However, in partially observable
(non-Markov) environments, standard model-learning methods learn generative
models, i.e. models that provide a probability distribution over all possible
futures (such as POMDPs). It is not straightforward to restrict such models to
make only certain predictions, and doing so does not always simplify the
learning problem. In this paper we present prediction profile models:
non-generative partial models for partially observable systems that make only a
given set of predictions, and are therefore far simpler than generative models
in some cases. We formalize the problem of learning a prediction profile model
as a transformation of the original model-learning problem, and show
empirically that one can learn prediction profile models that make a small set
of important predictions even in systems that are too complex for standard
generative models.",2014-01-16,2014,2014-01,environment
Efficient Planning under Uncertainty with Macro-actions,"Deciding how to act in partially observable environments remains an active
area of research. Identifying good sequences of decisions is particularly
challenging when good control performance requires planning multiple steps into
the future in domains with many states. Towards addressing this challenge, we
present an online, forward-search algorithm called the Posterior Belief
Distribution (PBD). PBD leverages a novel method for calculating the posterior
distribution over beliefs that result after a sequence of actions is taken,
given the set of observation sequences that could be received during this
process. This method allows us to efficiently evaluate the expected reward of a
sequence of primitive actions, which we refer to as macro-actions. We present a
formal analysis of our approach, and examine its performance on two very large
simulation experiments: scientific exploration and a target monitoring domain.
We also demonstrate our algorithm being used to control a real robotic
helicopter in a target monitoring experiment, which suggests that our approach
has practical potential for planning in real-world, large partially observable
domains where a multi-step lookahead is required to achieve good performance.",2014-01-16,2014,2014-01,environment
Safe Exploration of State and Action Spaces in Reinforcement Learning,"In this paper, we consider the important problem of safe exploration in
reinforcement learning. While reinforcement learning is well-suited to domains
with complex transition dynamics and high-dimensional state-action spaces, an
additional challenge is posed by the need for safe and efficient exploration.
Traditional exploration techniques are not particularly useful for solving
dangerous tasks, where the trial and error process may lead to the selection of
actions whose execution in some states may result in damage to the learning
system (or any other system). Consequently, when an agent begins an interaction
with a dangerous and high-dimensional state-action space, an important question
arises; namely, that of how to avoid (or at least minimize) damage caused by
the exploration of the state-action space. We introduce the PI-SRL algorithm
which safely improves suboptimal albeit robust behaviors for continuous state
and action control tasks and which efficiently learns from the experience
gained from the environment. We evaluate the proposed method in four complex
tasks: automatic car parking, pole-balancing, helicopter hovering, and business
management.",2014-02-04,2014,2014-02,environment
Intelligent User Interface in Fuzzy Environment,"Human-Computer Interaction with the traditional User Interface is done using
a specified in advance script dialog menu, mainly based on human intellect and
unproductive use of navigation. This approach does not lead to making
qualitative decision in control systems, where the situations and processes
cannot be structured in advance. Any dynamic changes in the controlled business
process (as example, in organizational unit of the information fuzzy control
system) make it necessary to modify the script dialogue in User Interface. This
circumstance leads to a redesign of the components of the User Interface and of
the entire control system. In the Intelligent User Interface, where the dialog
situations are unknown in advance, fuzzy structured and artificial intelligence
is crucial, the redesign described above is impossible. To solve this and other

Smart/ Intelligent User Interface (IUI) design, which interacts with users and

"Enaction-Based Artificial Intelligence: Toward Coevolution with Humans
  in the Loop","This article deals with the links between the enaction paradigm and
artificial intelligence. Enaction is considered a metaphor for artificial
intelligence, as a number of the notions which it deals with are deemed
incompatible with the phenomenal field of the virtual. After explaining this
stance, we shall review previous works regarding this issue in terms of
artifical life and robotics. We shall focus on the lack of recognition of
co-evolution at the heart of these approaches. We propose to explicitly
integrate the evolution of the environment into our approach in order to refine
the ontogenesis of the artificial system, and to compare it with the enaction
paradigm. The growing complexity of the ontogenetic mechanisms to be activated
can therefore be compensated by an interactive guidance system emanating from
the environment. This proposition does not however resolve that of the
relevance of the meaning created by the machine (sense-making). Such
reflections lead us to integrate human interaction into this environment in
order to construct relevant meaning in terms of participative artificial
intelligence. This raises a number of questions with regards to setting up an
enactive interaction. The article concludes by exploring a number of issues,
thereby enabling us to associate current approaches with the principles of
morphogenesis, guidance, the phenomenology of interactions and the use of
minimal enactive interfaces in setting up experiments which will deal with the

Since the prediction results are represented by intervals, the agents can
recognize and suspend those control actions, whose positive effect on the

a socially learned set of the environmental complexity. Maximizing the flow

Different environment models are defined in order to compute routing strategies

agents to meaningfully generalize. Projective simulation, a novel, physical

Specifically, we show that already in basic (but extreme) environments,

"An Empirical Comparison of Neural Architectures for Reinforcement
  Learning in Partially Observable Environments","This paper explores the performance of fitted neural Q iteration for
reinforcement learning in several partially observable environments, using
three recurrent neural network architectures: Long Short-Term Memory, Gated
Recurrent Unit and MUT1, a recurrent neural architecture evolved from a pool of
several thousands candidate architectures. A variant of fitted Q iteration,
based on Advantage values instead of Q values, is also explored. The results
show that GRU performs significantly better than LSTM and MUT1 for most of the

Deep Exploration via Bootstrapped DQN,"Efficient exploration in complex environments remains a major challenge for
reinforcement learning. We propose bootstrapped DQN, a simple algorithm that
explores in a computationally and statistically efficient manner through use of
randomized value functions. Unlike dithering strategies such as epsilon-greedy
exploration, bootstrapped DQN carries out temporally-extended (or deep)
exploration; this can lead to exponentially faster learning. We demonstrate
these benefits in complex stochastic MDPs and in the large-scale Arcade
Learning Environment. Bootstrapped DQN substantially improves learning times
and performance across most Atari games.",2016-02-15,2016,2016-02,environment
Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems and Applications: A Survey,"The field of Multi-Agent System (MAS) is an active area of research within
Artificial Intelligence, with an increasingly important impact in industrial

pursue personal interests and/or to achieve common objectives. Distributed
Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) have emerged as one of the prominent
agent architectures to govern the agents' autonomous behavior, where both
algorithms and communication models are driven by the structure of the specific
problem. During the last decade, several extensions to the DCOP model have
enabled them to support MAS in complex, real-time, and uncertain environments.
This survey aims at providing an overview of the DCOP model, giving a
classification of its multiple extensions and addressing both resolution
methods and applications that find a natural mapping within each class of
DCOPs. The proposed classification suggests several future perspectives for
DCOP extensions, and identifies challenges in the design of efficient
resolution algorithms, possibly through the adaptation of strategies from
different areas.",2016-02-20,2016,2016-02,environment
Thompson Sampling is Asymptotically Optimal in General Environments,"We discuss a variant of Thompson sampling for nonparametric reinforcement

Meta-learning within Projective Simulation,"Learning models of artificial intelligence can nowadays perform very well on
a large variety of tasks. However, in practice different task environments are
best handled by different learning models, rather than a single, universal,
approach. Most non-trivial models thus require the adjustment of several to
many learning parameters, which is often done on a case-by-case basis by an
external party. Meta-learning refers to the ability of an agent to autonomously
and dynamically adjust its own learning parameters, or meta-parameters. In this
work we show how projective simulation, a recently developed model of
artificial intelligence, can naturally be extended to account for meta-learning
in reinforcement learning settings. The projective simulation approach is based
on a random walk process over a network of clips. The suggested meta-learning
scheme builds upon the same design and employs clip networks to monitor the
agent's performance and to adjust its meta-parameters ""on the fly"". We
distinguish between ""reflexive adaptation"" and ""adaptation through learning"",
and show the utility of both approaches. In addition, a trade-off between
flexibility and learning-time is addressed. The extended model is examined on
three different kinds of reinforcement learning tasks, in which the agent has
different optimal values of the meta-parameters, and is shown to perform well,
reaching near-optimal to optimal success rates in all of them, without ever
needing to manually adjust any meta-parameter.",2016-02-25,2016,2016-02,environment
Category Theoretic Analysis of Photon-based Decision Making,"Decision making is a vital function in this age of machine learning and
artificial intelligence, yet its physical realization and theoretical

demonstrated that single-photons can be used to make decisions in uncertain,
dynamically changing environments. The two-armed bandit problem was
successfully solved using the dual probabilistic and particle attributes of
single photons. In this study, we present a category theoretic modeling and
analysis of single-photon-based decision making, including a quantitative
analysis that is in agreement with the experimental results. A category
theoretic model reveals the complex interdependencies of subject matter
entities in a simplified manner, even in dynamically changing environments. In
particular, the octahedral and braid structures in triangulated categories
provide a better understanding and quantitative metrics of the underlying
mechanisms of a single-photon decision maker. This study provides both insight

machine learning and artificial intelligence.",2016-02-26,2016,2016-02,environment
The AGI Containment Problem,"There is considerable uncertainty about what properties, capabilities and

security risks arising from accidents and defects. In order to mitigate these
risks, prudent early AGI research teams will perform significant testing on
their creations before use. Unfortunately, if an AGI has human-level or greater
intelligence, testing itself may not be safe; some natural AGI goal systems
create emergent incentives for AGIs to tamper with their test environments,
make copies of themselves on the internet, or convince developers and operators
to do dangerous things. In this paper, we survey the AGI containment problem -
the question of how to build a container in which tests can be conducted safely
and reliably, even on AGIs with unknown motivations and capabilities that could
be dangerous. We identify requirements for AGI containers, available

"Why Artificial Intelligence Needs a Task Theory --- And What It Might
  Look Like","The concept of ""task"" is at the core of artificial intelligence (AI): Tasks
are used for training and evaluating AI systems, which are built in order to
perform and automatize tasks we deem useful. In other fields of engineering
theoretical foundations allow thorough evaluation of designs by methodical
manipulation of well understood parameters with a known role and importance;
this allows an aeronautics engineer, for instance, to systematically assess the
effects of wind speed on an airplane's performance and stability. No framework
exists in AI that allows this kind of methodical manipulation: Performance
results on the few tasks in current use (cf. board games, question-answering)
cannot be easily compared, however similar or different. The issue is even more
acute with respect to artificial *general* intelligence systems, which must
handle unanticipated tasks whose specifics cannot be known beforehand. A *task
theory* would enable addressing tasks at the *class* level, bypassing their
specifics, providing the appropriate formalization and classification of tasks,
environments, and their parameters, resulting in more rigorous ways of
measuring, comparing, and evaluating intelligent behavior. Even modest
improvements in this direction would surpass the current ad-hoc nature of
machine learning and AI evaluation. Here we discuss the main elements of the
argument for a task theory and present an outline of what it might look like

Learning Purposeful Behaviour in the Absence of Rewards,"Artificial intelligence is commonly defined as the ability to achieve goals
in the world. In the reinforcement learning framework, goals are encoded as
reward functions that guide agent behaviour, and the sum of observed rewards
provide a notion of progress. However, some domains have no such reward signal,
or have a reward signal so sparse as to appear absent. Without reward feedback,
agent behaviour is typically random, often dithering aimlessly and lacking
intentionality. In this paper we present an algorithm capable of learning
purposeful behaviour in the absence of rewards. The algorithm proceeds by
constructing temporally extended actions (options), through the identification
of purposes that are ""just out of reach"" of the agent's current behaviour.
These purposes establish intrinsic goals for the agent to learn, ultimately
resulting in a suite of behaviours that encourage the agent to visit different
parts of the state space. Moreover, the approach is particularly suited for
settings where rewards are very sparse, and such behaviours can help in the
exploration of the environment until reward is observed.",2016-05-25,2016,2016-05,environment

Death and Suicide in Universal Artificial Intelligence,"Reinforcement learning (RL) is a general paradigm for studying intelligent
behaviour, with applications ranging from artificial intelligence to psychology
and economics. AIXI is a universal solution to the RL problem; it can learn any
computable environment. A technical subtlety of AIXI is that it is defined
using a mixture over semimeasures that need not sum to 1, rather than over
proper probability measures. In this work we argue that the shortfall of a
semimeasure can naturally be interpreted as the agent's estimate of the
probability of its death. We formally define death for generally intelligent
agents like AIXI, and prove a number of related theorems about their behaviour.
Notable discoveries include that agent behaviour can change radically under
positive linear transformations of the reward signal (from suicidal to
dogmatically self-preserving), and that the agent's posterior belief that it
will survive increases over time.",2016-06-02,2016,2016-06,environment
"Situated Structure Learning of a Bayesian Logic Network for Commonsense
  Reasoning","This paper details the implementation of an algorithm for automatically

including IsA, AtLocation, HasProperty, and UsedFor, with a corresponding
probability distribution that models the uncertainty inherent in these
relations. Inference over this network enables reasoning over the abstract
concepts in order to perform appropriate object substitution or to locate
missing objects in the robot's environment. The structure of the network is
generated by combining information from two existing knowledge sources:
ConceptNet (Speer and Havasi 2012), and WordNet (Miller 1995). This is done in
a ""situated"" manner by only including information relevant a given context.

factors, or sensorimotor contexts.

Playing SNES in the Retro Learning Environment,"Mastering a video game requires skill, tactics and strategy. While these

Self-Correcting Models for Model-Based Reinforcement Learning,"When an agent cannot represent a perfectly accurate model of its
environment's dynamics, model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) can fail
catastrophically. Planning involves composing the predictions of the model;
when flawed predictions are composed, even minor errors can compound and render
the model useless for planning. Hallucinated Replay (Talvitie 2014) trains the
model to ""correct"" itself when it produces errors, substantially improving MBRL
with flawed models. This paper theoretically analyzes this approach,
illuminates settings in which it is likely to be effective or ineffective, and
presents a novel error bound, showing that a model's ability to self-correct is
more tightly related to MBRL performance than one-step prediction error. These
results inspire an MBRL algorithm for deterministic MDPs with performance

Morphognosis: the shape of knowledge in space and time,"Artificial intelligence research to a great degree focuses on the brain and
behaviors that the brain generates. But the brain, an extremely complex
structure resulting from millions of years of evolution, can be viewed as a
solution to problems posed by an environment existing in space and time. The
environment generates signals that produce sensory events within an organism.
Building an internal spatial and temporal model of the environment allows an
organism to navigate and manipulate the environment. Higher intelligence might
be the ability to process information coming from a larger extent of
space-time. In keeping with nature's penchant for extending rather than
replacing, the purpose of the mammalian neocortex might then be to record
events from distant reaches of space and time and render them, as though yet
near and present, to the older, deeper brain whose instinctual roles have
changed little over eons. Here this notion is embodied in a model called
morphognosis (morpho = shape and gnosis = knowledge). Its basic structure is a
pyramid of event recordings called a morphognostic. At the apex of the pyramid
are the most recent and nearby events. Receding from the apex are less recent
and possibly more distant events. A morphognostic can thus be viewed as a
structure of progressively larger chunks of space-time knowledge. A set of
morphognostics forms long-term memories that are learned by exposure to the
environment. A cellular automaton is used as the platform to investigate the
morphognosis model, using a simulated organism that learns to forage in its

Minimally Naturalistic Artificial Intelligence,"The rapid advancement of machine learning techniques has re-energized
research into general artificial intelligence. While the idea of
domain-agnostic meta-learning is appealing, this emerging field must come to
terms with its relationship to human cognition and the statistics and structure
of the tasks humans perform. The position of this article is that only by
aligning our agents' abilities and environments with those of humans do we
stand a chance at developing general artificial intelligence (GAI). A broad
reading of the famous 'No Free Lunch' theorem is that there is no universally
optimal inductive bias or, equivalently, bias-free learning is impossible. This
follows from the fact that there are an infinite number of ways to extrapolate
data, any of which might be the one used by the data generating environment; an
inductive bias prefers some of these extrapolations to others, which lowers
performance in environments using these adversarial extrapolations. We may
posit that the optimal GAI is the one that maximally exploits the statistics of
its environment to create its inductive bias; accepting the fact that this
agent is guaranteed to be extremely sub-optimal for some alternative
environments. This trade-off appears benign when thinking about the environment
as being the physical universe, as performance on any fictive universe is
obviously irrelevant. But, we should expect a sharper inductive bias if we
further constrain our environment. Indeed, we implicitly do so by defining GAI
in terms of accomplishing that humans consider useful. One common version of
this is need the for 'common-sense reasoning', which implicitly appeals to the
statistics of physical universe as perceived by humans.",2017-01-14,2017,2017-01,environment

word embeddings trained on a Wikipedia corpus. The resulting word vectors are
treated as a common knowledge database which can be queried using linear
algebra. We apply this method to a reinforcement learning agent in a text-only

performance most of the time. Our method increases the computational complexity

"A Useful Motif for Flexible Task Learning in an Embodied Two-Dimensional
  Visual Environment","Animals (especially humans) have an amazing ability to learn new tasks
quickly, and switch between them flexibly. How brains support this ability is
largely unknown, both neuroscientifically and algorithmically. One reasonable
supposition is that modules drawing on an underlying general-purpose sensory
representation are dynamically allocated on a per-task basis. Recent results
from neuroscience and artificial intelligence suggest the role of the general
purpose visual representation may be played by a deep convolutional neural
network, and give some clues how task modules based on such a representation
might be discovered and constructed. In this work, we investigate module
architectures in an embodied two-dimensional touchscreen environment, in which
an agent's learning must occur via interactions with an environment that emits
images and rewards, and accepts touches as input. This environment is designed
to capture the physical structure of the task environments that are commonly
deployed in visual neuroscience and psychophysics. We show that in this
context, very simple changes in the nonlinear activations used by such a module
can significantly influence how fast it is at learning visual tasks and how
suitable it is for switching to new tasks.",2017-06-22,2017,2017-06,environment
OPEB: Open Physical Environment Benchmark for Artificial Intelligence,"Artificial Intelligence methods to solve continuous- control tasks have made

benchmarks are needed to evaluate and compare proposed algorithms. In this
paper, we propose a physical environment benchmark framework to facilitate
collaborative research in this area by enabling different research groups to
integrate their designed benchmarks in a unified cloud-based repository and
also share their actual implemented benchmarks via the cloud. We demonstrate
the proposed framework using an actual implementation of the classical

"Maintaining cooperation in complex social dilemmas using deep
  reinforcement learning","Social dilemmas are situations where individuals face a temptation to
increase their payoffs at a cost to total welfare. Building artificially
intelligent agents that achieve good outcomes in these situations is important
because many real world interactions include a tension between selfish
interests and the welfare of others. We show how to modify modern reinforcement
learning methods to construct agents that act in ways that are simple to
understand, nice (begin by cooperating), provokable (try to avoid being
exploited), and forgiving (try to return to mutual cooperation). We show both
theoretically and experimentally that such agents can maintain cooperation in
Markov social dilemmas. Our construction does not require training methods
beyond a modification of self-play, thus if an environment is such that good
strategies can be constructed in the zero-sum case (eg. Atari) then we can
construct agents that solve social dilemmas in this environment.",2017-07-04,2017,2017-07,environment
"Learning to Design Games: Strategic Environments in Reinforcement
  Learning","In typical reinforcement learning (RL), the environment is assumed given and
the goal of the learning is to identify an optimal policy for the agent taking
actions through its interactions with the environment. In this paper, we extend
this setting by considering the environment is not given, but controllable and
learnable through its interaction with the agent at the same time. This
extension is motivated by environment design scenarios in the real-world,
including game design, shopping space design and traffic signal design.
Theoretically, we find a dual Markov decision process (MDP) w.r.t. the
environment to that w.r.t. the agent, and derive a policy gradient solution to
optimizing the parametrized environment. Furthermore, discontinuous
environments are addressed by a proposed general generative framework. Our

algorithms in generating diverse and challenging Mazes against various agent

CMA-ES to train neural network controllers acting on this input data. As the
behavior of the agent changes the nature of the input data, the autoencoder
training progresses throughout evolution. We test this method in the VizDoom

What Automated Planning can do for Business Process Management,"Business Process Management (BPM) is a central element of today
organizations. Despite over the years its main focus has been the support of
processes in highly controlled domains, nowadays many domains of interest to
the BPM community are characterized by ever-changing requirements,
unpredictable environments and increasing amounts of data that influence the
execution of process instances. Under such dynamic conditions, BPM systems must
increase their level of automation to provide the reactivity and flexibility
necessary for process management. On the other hand, the Artificial
Intelligence (AI) community has concentrated its efforts on investigating
dynamic domains that involve active control of computational entities and
physical devices (e.g., robots, software agents, etc.). In this context,
Automated Planning, which is one of the oldest areas in AI, is conceived as a
model-based approach to synthesize autonomous behaviours in automated way from
a model. In this paper, we discuss how automated planning techniques can be
leveraged to enable new levels of automation and support for business

to the different stages of the BPM life cycle.",2017-09-29,2017,2017-09,environment

Emergent Complexity via Multi-Agent Competition,"Reinforcement learning algorithms can train agents that solve problems in
complex, interesting environments. Normally, the complexity of the trained
agent is closely related to the complexity of the environment. This suggests
that a highly capable agent requires a complex environment for training. In
this paper, we point out that a competitive multi-agent environment trained
with self-play can produce behaviors that are far more complex than the
environment itself. We also point out that such environments come with a
natural curriculum, because for any skill level, an environment full of agents
of this level will have the right level of difficulty. This work introduces
several competitive multi-agent environments where agents compete in a 3D world
with simulated physics. The trained agents learn a wide variety of complex and
interesting skills, even though the environment themselves are relatively
simple. The skills include behaviors such as running, blocking, ducking,
tackling, fooling opponents, kicking, and defending using both arms and legs. A

the identification of Activities of Daily Living (ADL). ADL can be identified
by use of the sensors available in many off-the-shelf mobile devices, including
magnetic and motion, and the environment can be also identified using acoustic
sensors. The study presented in this paper is divided in two parts: firstly, we
discuss the recognition of the environment using acoustic sensors (i.e.,
microphone), and secondly, we fuse this information with motion and magnetic
sensors (i.e., motion and magnetic sensors) for the recognition of standing
activities of daily living. The recognition of the environments and the ADL are
performed using pattern recognition techniques, in order to develop a system

Null Dynamical State Models of Human Cognitive Dysfunction,"The hard problem in artificial intelligence asks how the shuffling of
syntactical symbols in a program can lead to systems which experience semantics
and qualia. We address this question in three stages. First, we introduce a new
class of human semantic symbols which appears when unexpected and drastic
environmental change causes humans to become surprised, confused, uncertain,
and in extreme cases, unresponsive, passive and dysfunctional. For this class
of symbols, pre-learned programs become inoperative so these syntactical
programs cannot be the source of experienced qualia. Second, we model the
dysfunctional human response to a radically changed environment as being the
natural response of any learning machine facing novel inputs from well outside
its previous training set. In this situation, learning machines are unable to
extract information from their input and will typically enter a dynamical state
characterized by null outputs and a lack of response. This state immediately
predicts and explains the characteristics of the semantic experiences of humans
in similar circumstances. In the third stage, we consider learning machines
trained to implement multiple functions in simple sequential programs using
environmental data to specify subroutine names, control flow instructions,
memory calls, and so on. Drastic change in any of these environmental inputs
can again lead to inoperative programs. By examining changes specific to people
or locations we can model human cognitive symbols featuring these dependencies,
such as attachment and grief. Our approach links known dynamical machines
states with human qualia and thus offers new insight into the hard problem of
artificial intelligence.",2017-12-25,2017,2017-12,environment

Deep Reinforcement Learning using Capsules in Advanced Game Environments,"Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a research area that has blossomed
tremendously in recent years and has shown remarkable potential for artificial

to vast capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNet), enabling
algorithms to extract useful information from noisy environments. Capsule
Network (CapsNet) is a recent introduction to the Deep Learning algorithm group
and has only barely begun to be explored. The network is an architecture for
image classification, with superior performance for classification of the MNIST
dataset. CapsNets have not been explored beyond image classification.
  This thesis introduces the use of CapsNet for Q-Learning based game
algorithms. To successfully apply CapsNet in advanced game play, three main
contributions follow. First, the introduction of four new game environments as
frameworks for RL research with increasing complexity, namely Flash RL, Deep
Line Wars, Deep RTS, and Deep Maze. These environments fill the gap between
relatively simple and more complex game environments available for RL research
and are in the thesis used to test and explore the CapsNet behavior.
  Second, the thesis introduces a generative modeling approach to produce
artificial training data for use in Deep Learning models including CapsNets. We
empirically show that conditional generative modeling can successfully generate
game data of sufficient quality to train a Deep Q-Network well.
  Third, we show that CapsNet is a reliable architecture for Deep Q-Learning
based algorithms for game AI. A capsule is a group of neurons that determine
the presence of objects in the data and is in the literature shown to increase
the robustness of training and predictions while lowering the amount training
data needed. It should, therefore, be ideally suited for game plays.",2018-01-29,2018,2018-01,environment

Learning to Navigate in Cities Without a Map,"Navigating through unstructured environments is a basic capability of

grounded by recognisable landmarks and robust visual processing, that can
simultaneously support continuous self-localisation (""I am here"") and a
representation of the goal (""I am going there""). Building upon recent research
that applies deep reinforcement learning to maze navigation problems, we

visitation frequency detection. We were able to detect patient's face (Mean
average precision (mAP)=0.94), recognize patient's face (mAP=0.80), and their

night, light levels, and sound pressure levels during the night were
significantly different between delirious and non-delirious patients

Artificial Intelligence Inspired Self-Deployment of Wireless Networks,"In this paper, we propose a self-deployment approach for finding the optimal
placement of extenders in which both the wireless back-haul and front-haul
throughput of the extender are optimized. We present an artificial intelligence
(AI) case based reasoning (CBR) framework that enables autonomous
self-deployment in which the network can learn the environment by means of
sensing and perception. New actions, i.e. extender positions, are created by
problem-specific optimization and semi-supervised learning algorithms that
balance exploration and exploitation of the search space. An IEEE 802.11
standard compliant simulations are performed to evaluate the framework on a
large scale and compare its performance against existing conventional coverage
maximization approaches. Experimental evaluation is also performed in an
enterprise environment to demonstrate the competence of the proposed
AI-framework in perceiving such a dense scenario and reason the extender
deployment that achieves user quality of service (QoS). Throughput fairness and
ubiquitous QoS satisfaction are achieved which provide a leap to apply
AI-driven self-deployment in wireless networks.",2018-05-16,2018,2018-05,environment

"A unified strategy for implementing curiosity and empowerment driven
  reinforcement learning","Although there are many approaches to implement intrinsically motivated
artificial agents, the combined usage of multiple intrinsic drives remains
still a relatively unexplored research area. Specifically, we hypothesize that
a mechanism capable of quantifying and controlling the evolution of the
information flow between the agent and the environment could be the fundamental
component for implementing a higher degree of autonomy into artificial
intelligent agents. This paper propose a unified strategy for implementing two
semantically orthogonal intrinsic motivations: curiosity and empowerment.
Curiosity reward informs the agent about the relevance of a recent agent
action, whereas empowerment is implemented as the opposite information flow
from the agent to the environment that quantifies the agent's potential of
controlling its own future. We show that an additional homeostatic drive is
derived from the curiosity reward, which generalizes and enhances the
information gain of a classical curious/heterostatic reinforcement learning
agent. We show how a shared internal model by curiosity and empowerment
facilitates a more efficient training of the empowerment function. Finally, we
discuss future directions for further leveraging the interplay between these
two intrinsic rewards.",2018-06-18,2018,2018-06,environment

If a minimal simulation with sufficient capabilities is created, it might
manage to increase its own speed by accelerating progress in science and

ultimately lead to large simulated civilizations unfolding at extreme temporal
speedups, achieving what from the outside would look like a Temporal

"Deep RTS: A Game Environment for Deep Reinforcement Learning in
  Real-Time Strategy Games","Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of research that has blossomed
tremendously in recent years and has shown remarkable potential for artificial
intelligence based opponents in computer games. This success is primarily due
to the vast capabilities of convolutional neural networks, that can extract
useful features from noisy and complex data. Games are excellent tools to test
and push the boundaries of novel RL algorithms because they give valuable
insight into how well an algorithm can perform in isolated environments without
the real-life consequences. Real-time strategy games (RTS) is a genre that has
tremendous complexity and challenges the player in short and long-term
planning. There is much research that focuses on applied RL in RTS games, and
novel advances are therefore anticipated in the not too distant future.
However, there are to date few environments for testing RTS AIs. Environments
in the literature are often either overly simplistic, such as microRTS, or
complex and without the possibility for accelerated learning on consumer
hardware like StarCraft II. This paper introduces the Deep RTS game environment
for testing cutting-edge artificial intelligence algorithms for RTS games. Deep

intelligence research. It supports accelerated learning, meaning that it can
learn at a magnitude of 50 000 times faster compared to existing RTS games.
Deep RTS has a flexible configuration, enabling research in several different
RTS scenarios, including partially observable state-spaces and map complexity.
We show that Deep RTS lives up to our promises by comparing its performance

"Using Artificial Intelligence to Support Compliance with the General

that will replace the existing Data Protection Directive on 25 May 2018. The
most significant change is a huge increase in the maximum fine that can be

fully aware of GDPR - and a number of those who were preparing for it stopped
doing so when the Brexit vote was announced. A last-minute rush to become
compliant is therefore expected, and numerous companies are starting to offer
advice, checklists and consultancy on how to comply with GDPR. In such an
environment, artificial intelligence technologies ought to be able to assist by
providing best advice; asking all and only the relevant questions; monitoring
activities; and carrying out assessments. The paper considers four areas of
GDPR compliance where rule based technologies and/or machine learning
techniques may be relevant: * Following compliance checklists and codes of
conduct; * Supporting risk assessments; * Complying with the new regulations
regarding technologies that perform automatic profiling; * Complying with the
new regulations concerning recognising and reporting breaches of security. It
concludes that AI technology can support each of these four areas. The
requirements that GDPR (or organisations that need to comply with GDPR) state

"Analysis of Fleet Modularity in an Artificial Intelligence-Based

widespread for ground vehicles, a large number of vehicles and equipment become
quickly obsolete. A possible solution for the U.S. Army is to develop fleets of
modular military vehicles, which are built by interchangeable substantial

plug-in/pull-out actions, which allows for real-time fleet reconfiguration to
meet dynamic demands. Moreover, military demands are time-varying and highly
stochastic because commanders keep reacting to enemy's actions. To capture
these characteristics, we formulated an intelligent agent-based model to
imitate decision making process during fleet operation, which combines
real-time optimization with artificial intelligence. The agents are capable of

On the Complexity of Exploration in Goal-Driven Navigation,"Building agents that can explore their environments intelligently is a
challenging open problem. In this paper, we make a step towards understanding
how a hierarchical design of the agent's policy can affect its exploration

figure out how to navigate to the exit by accomplishing a number of
intermediate tasks (\emph{subgoals}), such as finding keys or opening doors.
Our environments are procedurally generated and vary in complexity, which can
be controlled by the number of subgoals and relationships between them. Next,
we propose to measure the complexity of each environment by constructing
dependency graphs between the goals and analytically computing \emph{hitting
times} of a random walk in the graph. We empirically evaluate Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) with sparse and shaped rewards, a variation of policy
sketches, and a hierarchical version of PPO (called HiPPO) akin to h-DQN. We
show that analytically estimated \emph{hitting time} in goal dependency graphs
is an informative metric of the environment complexity. We conjecture that the
result should hold for environments other than navigation. Finally, we show
that solving environments beyond certain level of complexity requires
hierarchical approaches.",2018-11-16,2018,2018-11,environment

  Watchdog Artificial Intelligence Agents","Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies could be broadly categorised into
Analytics and Autonomy. Analytics focuses on algorithms offering perception,
comprehension, and projection of knowledge gleaned from sensorial data.
Autonomy revolves around decision making, and influencing and shaping the
environment through action production. A smart autonomous system (SAS) combines
analytics and autonomy to understand, learn, decide and act autonomously. To be
useful, SAS must be trusted and that requires testing. Lifelong learning of a
SAS compounds the testing process. In the remote chance that it is possible to
fully test and certify the system pre-release, which is theoretically an
undecidable problem, it is near impossible to predict the future behaviours
that these systems, alone or collectively, will exhibit. While it may be
feasible to severely restrict such systems\textquoteright \ learning abilities
to limit the potential unpredictability of their behaviours, an undesirable
consequence may be severely limiting their utility. In this paper, we propose
the architecture for a watchdog AI (WAI) agent dedicated to lifelong functional
testing of SAS. We further propose system specifications including a level of
abstraction whereby humans shepherd a swarm of WAI agents to oversee an
ecosystem made of humans and SAS. The discussion extends to the challenges,
pros, and cons of the proposed concept.",2018-12-21,2018,2018-12,environment
"Optimal Decision-Making in Mixed-Agent Partially Observable Stochastic
  Environments via Reinforcement Learning","Optimal decision making with limited or no information in stochastic
environments where multiple agents interact is a challenging topic in the realm
of artificial intelligence. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a popular approach
for arriving at optimal strategies by predicating stimuli, such as the reward
for following a strategy, on experience. RL is heavily explored in the
single-agent context, but is a nascent concept in multiagent problems. To this
end, I propose several principled model-free and partially model-based
reinforcement learning approaches for several multiagent settings. In the realm
of normative reinforcement learning, I introduce scalable extensions to Monte
Carlo exploring starts for partially observable Markov Decision Processes
(POMDP), dubbed MCES-P, where I expand the theory and algorithm to the
multiagent setting. I first examine MCES-P with probably approximately correct
(PAC) bounds in the context of multiagent setting, showing MCESP+PAC holds in
the presence of other agents. I then propose a more sample-efficient
methodology for antagonistic settings, MCESIP+PAC. For cooperative settings, I
extend MCES-P to the Multiagent POMDP, dubbed MCESMP+PAC. I then explore the
use of reinforcement learning as a methodology in searching for optima in
realistic and latent model environments. First, I explore a parameterized
Q-learning approach in modeling humans learning to reason in an uncertain,
multiagent environment. Next, I propose an implementation of MCES-P, along with
image segmentation, to create an adaptive team-based reinforcement learning
technique to positively identify the presence of phenotypically-expressed water

"Learning and Reasoning for Robot Sequential Decision Making under
  Uncertainty","Robots frequently face complex tasks that require more than one action, where
sequential decision-making (SDM) capabilities become necessary. The key
contribution of this work is a robot SDM framework, called LCORPP, that
supports the simultaneous capabilities of supervised learning for passive state
estimation, automated reasoning with declarative human knowledge, and planning
under uncertainty toward achieving long-term goals. In particular, we use a
hybrid reasoning paradigm to refine the state estimator, and provide
informative priors for the probabilistic planner. In experiments, a mobile
robot is tasked with estimating human intentions using their motion
trajectories, declarative contextual knowledge, and human-robot interaction
(dialog-based and motion-based). Results suggest that, in efficiency and

Learning Independently-Obtainable Reward Functions,"We present a novel method for learning a set of disentangled reward functions
that sum to the original environment reward and are constrained to be
independently obtainable. We define independent obtainability in terms of value
functions with respect to obtaining one learned reward while pursuing another
learned reward. Empirically, we illustrate that our method can learn meaningful
reward decompositions in a variety of domains and that these decompositions
exhibit some form of generalization performance when the environment's reward
is modified. Theoretically, we derive results about the effect of maximizing
our method's objective on the resulting reward functions and their
corresponding optimal policies.",2019-01-24,2019,2019-01,environment
Modularization of End-to-End Learning: Case Study in Arcade Games,"Complex environments and tasks pose a difficult problem for holistic
end-to-end learning approaches. Decomposition of an environment into
interacting controllable and non-controllable objects allows supervised
learning for non-controllable objects and universal value function approximator
learning for controllable objects. Such decomposition should lead to a shorter
learning time and better generalisation capability. Here, we consider
arcade-game environments as sets of interacting objects (controllable,
non-controllable) and propose a set of functional modules that are specialized
on mastering different types of interactions in a broad range of environments.
The modules utilize regression, supervised learning, and reinforcement learning
algorithms. Results of this case study in different Atari games suggest that
human-level performance can be achieved by a learning agent within a human
amount of game experience (10-15 minutes game time) when a proper decomposition
of an environment or a task is provided. However, automatization of such
decomposition remains a challenging problem. This case study shows how a model
of a causal structure underlying an environment or a task can benefit learning
time and generalization capability of the agent, and argues in favor of
exploiting modular structure in contrast to using pure end-to-end learning
approaches.",2019-01-27,2019,2019-01,environment

The Hanabi Challenge: A New Frontier for AI Research,"From the early days of computing, games have been important testbeds for
studying how well machines can do sophisticated decision making. In recent
years, machine learning has made dramatic advances with artificial agents
reaching superhuman performance in challenge domains like Go, Atari, and some
variants of poker. As with their predecessors of chess, checkers, and
backgammon, these game domains have driven research by providing sophisticated
yet well-defined challenges for artificial intelligence practitioners. We
continue this tradition by proposing the game of Hanabi as a new challenge
domain with novel problems that arise from its combination of purely
cooperative gameplay with two to five players and imperfect information. In
particular, we argue that Hanabi elevates reasoning about the beliefs and
intentions of other agents to the foreground. We believe developing novel
techniques for such theory of mind reasoning will not only be crucial for
success in Hanabi, but also in broader collaborative efforts, especially those
with human partners. To facilitate future research, we introduce the
open-source Hanabi Learning Environment, propose an experimental framework for

Learning to Learn in Simulation,"Deep learning often requires the manual collection and annotation of a

curiosity as it relates to online, real-time, human-in-the-loop training of an
object detection algorithm onboard a drone, where motion is constrained to two
dimensions. We use a 3D simulation environment and deep reinforcement learning
to train a curiosity agent to, in turn, train the object detection model. This
agent could have one of two conflicting objectives: train as quickly as
possible, or train with minimal human input. We outline a reward function that
allows the curiosity agent to learn either of these objectives, while taking
into account some of the physical characteristics of the drone platform on
which it is meant to run. In addition, We show that we can weigh the importance
of achieving these objectives by adjusting a parameter in the reward function.",2019-02-05,2019,2019-02,environment

A Strongly Asymptotically Optimal Agent in General Environments,"Reinforcement Learning agents are expected to eventually perform well.
Typically, this takes the form of a guarantee about the asymptotic behavior of
an algorithm given some assumptions about the environment. We present an

probability 1 in all computable probabilistic environments, provided the agent
has a bounded horizon. This is known as strong asymptotic optimality, and it
was previously unknown whether it was possible for a policy to be strongly
asymptotically optimal in the class of all computable probabilistic
environments. Our agent, Inquisitive Reinforcement Learner (Inq), is more
likely to explore the more it expects an exploratory action to reduce its
uncertainty about which environment it is in, hence the term inquisitive.
Exploring inquisitively is a strategy that can be applied generally; for more
manageable environment classes, inquisitiveness is tractable. We conducted

Autonomous Penetration Testing using Reinforcement Learning,"Penetration testing (pentesting) involves performing a controlled attack on a

for testing security, pentesting requires highly skilled practitioners and
currently there is a growing shortage of skilled cyber security professionals.
One avenue for alleviating this problem is automate the pentesting process

pentesting have relied on model-based planning, however the cyber security
landscape is rapidly changing making maintaining up-to-date models of exploits
a challenge. This project investigated the application of model-free
Reinforcement Learning (RL) to automated pentesting. Model-free RL has the key
advantage over model-based planning of not requiring a model of the
environment, instead learning the best policy through interaction with the
environment. We first designed and built a fast, low compute simulator for
training and testing autonomous pentesting agents. We did this by framing
pentesting as a Markov Decision Process with the known configuration of the
network as states, the available scans and exploits as actions, the reward
determined by the value of machines on the network. We then used this simulator
to investigate the application of model-free RL to pentesting. We tested the
standard Q-learning algorithm using both tabular and neural network based
implementations. We found that within the simulated environment both tabular
and neural network implementations were able to find optimal attack paths for a
range of different network topologies and sizes without having a model of
action behaviour. However, the implemented algorithms were only practical for

scientists are not familiar with the unique requirements and characteristics of
HPC environments. They usually develop their applications with high-level
scripting languages or frameworks such as TensorFlow and the installation
process often requires connection to external systems to download open source
software during the build. HPC environments, on the other hand, are often based
on closed source applications that incorporate parallel and distributed
computing API's such as MPI and OpenMP, while users have restricted

"Cognitively-inspired Agent-based Service Composition for Mobile &
  Pervasive Computing","Automatic service composition in mobile and pervasive computing faces many
challenges due to the complex and highly dynamic nature of the environment.
Common approaches consider service composition as a decision problem whose
solution is usually addressed from optimization perspectives which are not
feasible in practice due to the intractability of the problem, limited
computational resources of smart devices, service host's mobility, and time
constraints to tailor composition plans. Thus, our main contribution is the
development of a cognitively-inspired agent-based service composition model
focused on bounded rationality rather than optimality, which allows the system
to compensate for limited resources by selectively filtering out continuous
streams of data. Our approach exhibits features such as distributedness,
modularity, emergent global functionality, and robustness, which endow it with
capabilities to perform decentralized service composition by orchestrating
manifold service providers and conflicting goals from multiple users. The
evaluation of our approach shows promising results when compared against
state-of-the-art service composition models.",2019-05-29,2019,2019-05,environment

2019 Evolutionary Algorithms Review,"Evolutionary algorithm research and applications began over 50 years ago.
Like other artificial intelligence techniques, evolutionary algorithms will
likely see increased use and development due to the increased availability of

increasing demand for artificial intelligence techniques. As these techniques
become more adopted and capable, it is the right time to take a perspective of
their ability to integrate into society and the human processes they intend to

and resulting classifications that look at five main areas: the ability to
manage the control of the environment with limiters, the ability to explain and
repeat the search process, the ability to understand input and output causality
within a solution, the ability to manage algorithm bias due to data or user
design, and lastly, the ability to add corrective measures. These areas are
motivated by today's pressures on industry to conform to both societies

"Escaping the State of Nature: A Hobbesian Approach to Cooperation in
  Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning","Cooperation is a phenomenon that has been widely studied across many
different disciplines. In the field of computer science, the modularity and
robustness of multi-agent systems offer significant practical advantages over
individual machines. At the same time, agents using standard reinforcement
learning algorithms often fail to achieve long-term, cooperative strategies in
unstable environments when there are short-term incentives to defect. Political
philosophy, on the other hand, studies the evolution of cooperation in humans
who face similar incentives to act individualistically, but nevertheless
succeed in forming societies. Thomas Hobbes in Leviathan provides the classic
analysis of the transition from a pre-social State of Nature, where consistent
defection results in a constant state of war, to stable political community
through the institution of an absolute Sovereign. This thesis argues that
Hobbes's natural and moral philosophy are strikingly applicable to artificially
intelligent agents and aims to show that his political solutions are
experimentally successful in producing cooperation among modified Q-Learning
agents. Cooperative play is achieved in a novel Sequential Social Dilemma
called the Civilization Game, which models the State of Nature by introducing

Shaping Belief States with Generative Environment Models for RL,"When agents interact with a complex environment, they must form and maintain
beliefs about the relevant aspects of that environment. We propose a way to
efficiently train expressive generative models in complex environments. We show
that a predictive algorithm with an expressive generative model can form stable
belief-states in visually rich and dynamic 3D environments. More precisely, we
show that the learned representation captures the layout of the environment as
well as the position and orientation of the agent. Our experiments show that
the model substantially improves data-efficiency on a number of reinforcement
learning (RL) tasks compared with strong model-free baseline agents. We find
that predicting multiple steps into the future (overshooting), in combination
with an expressive generative model, is critical for stable representations to
emerge. In practice, using expressive generative models in RL is
computationally expensive and we propose a scheme to reduce this computational
burden, allowing us to build agents that are competitive with model-free
baselines.",2019-06-21,2019,2019-06,environment

"An Actor-Critic-Attention Mechanism for Deep Reinforcement Learning in
  Multi-view Environments","In reinforcement learning algorithms, leveraging multiple views of the
environment can improve the learning of complicated policies. In multi-view
environments, due to the fact that the views may frequently suffer from partial
observability, their level of importance are often different. In this paper, we
propose a deep reinforcement learning method and an attention mechanism in a
multi-view environment. Each view can provide various representative
information about the environment. Through our attention mechanism, our method
generates a single feature representation of environment given its multiple
views. It learns a policy to dynamically attend to each view based on its
importance in the decision-making process. Through experiments, we show that

augment a baseline instruction-following learner with an initial
environment-learning phase that uses observations of language-free state
transitions to induce a suitable latent representation of actions before
processing the instruction-following training data. We show that mapping to

Environment Probing Interaction Policies,"A key challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) is environment generalization:
a policy trained to solve a task in one environment often fails to solve the
same task in a slightly different test environment. A common approach to
improve inter-environment transfer is to learn policies that are invariant to
the distribution of testing environments. However, we argue that instead of
being invariant, the policy should identify the specific nuances of an
environment and exploit them to achieve better performance. In this work, we
propose the 'Environment-Probing' Interaction (EPI) policy, a policy that
probes a new environment to extract an implicit understanding of that
environment's behavior. Once this environment-specific information is obtained,
it is used as an additional input to a task-specific policy that can now
perform environment-conditioned actions to solve a task. To learn these
EPI-policies, we present a reward function based on transition predictability.
Specifically, a higher reward is given if the trajectory generated by the
EPI-policy can be used to better predict transitions. We experimentally show
that EPI-conditioned task-specific policies significantly outperform commonly
used policy generalization methods on novel testing environments.",2019-07-26,2019,2019-07,environment

Responsive Planning and Recognition for Closed-Loop Interaction,"Many intelligent systems currently interact with others using at least one of

to the current situation unless it was specifically implemented. Closed-loop
interaction instead focuses on dynamic responses that account for what the user
is currently doing based on interpretations of their perceived activity. Agents
employing closed-loop interaction can also monitor their interactions to ensure
that the user responds as expected. We introduce a closed-loop interactive

for instance the typical setting in which, e.g., artificial agents for
video-games (the so called ""bots""), cleaning robots, bomb clearing robots, and

in which the operations of the agent are distinguished in ""sensing"" the
environment with proper interface devices, ""thinking"", and then behaving
accordingly using proper actuators. In order to operate in an highly reactive

be able to react repeatedly and in a reasonable amount of time; 2. Elastic ->
The agent must stay reactive also under varying workload; 3. Resilient -> The
agent must stay responsive also in case of internal failure or failure of one
of the programmed actions in the environment. Nowadays, thanks to new

computation-power conservative and thus is acceptable for use in mobile devices
such as single-board computers, which are often used in mobile robotic agents.
This R-HGN approach is validated against individual behaviour implementation

behaviour. This shift from heavy exploration to heavy exploitation can be
represented as decay in the $\varepsilon$ value, where $\varepsilon$ depicts
the how much an agent is allowed to explore. This paper proposes a new approach
to this $\varepsilon$ decay where the decay is based on feedback from the
environment. This paper also compares and contrasts one such approach based on
rewards and compares it against standard exponential decay. The new approach,
in the environments tested, produces more consistent results that on average
perform better.",2019-10-30,2019,2019-10,environment
"Continuous Control with Contexts, Provably","A fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence is to build an agent that
generalizes and adapts to unseen environments. A common strategy is to build a
decoder that takes the context of the unseen new environment as input and
generates a policy accordingly. The current paper studies how to build a
decoder for the fundamental continuous control task, linear quadratic regulator
(LQR), which can model a wide range of real-world physical environments. We
present a simple algorithm for this problem, which uses upper confidence bound
(UCB) to refine the estimate of the decoder and balance the
exploration-exploitation trade-off. Theoretically, our algorithm enjoys a
$\widetilde{O}\left(\sqrt{T}\right)$ regret bound in the online setting where
$T$ is the number of environments the agent played. This also implies after
playing $\widetilde{O}\left(1/\epsilon^2\right)$ environments, the agent is
able to transfer the learned knowledge to obtain an $\epsilon$-suboptimal
policy for an unseen environment. To our knowledge, this is first provably
efficient algorithm to build a decoder in the continuous control setting. While
our main focus is theoretical, we also present experiments that demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm.",2019-10-30,2019,2019-10,environment

Being Optimistic to Be Conservative: Quickly Learning a CVaR Policy,"While maximizing expected return is the goal in most reinforcement learning
approaches, risk-sensitive objectives such as conditional value at risk (CVaR)
are more suitable for many high-stakes applications. However, relatively little
is known about how to explore to quickly learn policies with good CVaR. In this
paper, we present the first algorithm for sample-efficient learning of
CVaR-optimal policies in Markov decision processes based on the optimism in the
face of uncertainty principle. This method relies on a novel optimistic version
of the distributional Bellman operator that moves probability mass from the
lower to the upper tail of the return distribution. We prove asymptotic
convergence and optimism of this operator for the tabular policy evaluation
case. We further demonstrate that our algorithm finds CVaR-optimal policies
substantially faster than existing baselines in several simulated environments
with discrete and continuous state spaces.",2019-11-05,2019,2019-11,environment

"Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) for 6G: Improving Trust

benefits, the design phase for the 6th Generation (6G) has started. 6G will
need to enable greater levels of autonomy, improve human machine interfacing,

increased explainability to enable trust is critical for 6G as it manages a
wide range of mission critical services (e.g. autonomous driving) to safety
critical tasks (e.g. remote surgery). As we migrate from traditional
model-based optimisation to deep learning, the trust we have in our

option-critic policy gradient theorem for the average reward criterion. Our
proposed framework aims to maximize the long-term reward obtained in the
steady-state of the Markov chain defined by the agent's policy. Furthermore, we
use an ordinary differential equation based approach for our convergence
analysis and prove that the parameters of the intra-option policies,

the environment, thus explicitly characterizing the exploration-exploitation
tradeoff. The resulting cumulative regret bound depends on the agent's
uncertainty over the environment and quantifies the value of prior information.
We show applicability of this approach to several environments, including
linear bandits, tabular MDPs, and factored MDPs. These examples demonstrate the

is key to maximize the benefits and minimize the risks stemming from AI
technologies. Developing regulatory frameworks is, however, challenging due to
AI's global reach and the existence of widespread misconceptions about the
notion of regulation. We argue that AI-related challenges cannot be tackled
effectively without sincere international coordination supported by robust,
consistent domestic and international governance arrangements. Against this
backdrop, we propose the establishment of an international AI governance
framework organized around a new AI regulatory agency that -- drawing on
interdisciplinary expertise -- could help creating uniform standards for the
regulation of AI technologies and inform the development of AI policies around
the world. We also believe that a fundamental change of mindset on what
constitutes regulation is necessary to remove existing barriers that hamper
contemporary efforts to develop AI regulatory regimes, and put forward some
recommendations on how to achieve this, and what opportunities doing so would
present.",2020-05-22,2020,2020-05,environment
Learning visual servo policies via planner cloning,"Learning control policies for visual servoing in novel environments is an
important problem. However, standard model-free policy learning methods are

We propose Penalized Q Cloning (PQC), a new behavior cloning algorithm. We show
that it outperforms several baselines and ablations on some challenging
problems involving visual servoing in novel environments while avoiding

effectively onto a real robotic platform, achieving approximately an 87%

"Synergetic Learning Systems: Concept, Architecture, and Algorithms","Drawing on the idea that brain development is a Darwinian process of
``evolution + selection'' and the idea that the current state is a local
equilibrium state of many bodies with self-organization and evolution processes
driven by the temperature and gravity in our universe, in this work, we
describe an artificial intelligence system called the ``Synergetic Learning
Systems''. The system is composed of two or more subsystems (models, agents or
virtual bodies), and it is an open complex giant system. Inspired by natural
intelligence, the system achieves intelligent information processing and
decision-making in a given environment through cooperative/competitive
synergetic learning. The intelligence evolved by the natural law of ``it is not
the strongest of the species that survives, but the one most responsive to
change,'' while an artificial intelligence system should adopt the law of
``human selection'' in the evolution process. Therefore, we expect that the
proposed system architecture can also be adapted in human-machine synergy or
multi-agent synergetic systems. It is also expected that under our design
criteria, the proposed system will eventually achieve artificial general
intelligence through long term coevolution.",2020-05-31,2020,2020-05,environment

Designing Environments Conducive to Interpretable Robot Behavior,"Designing robots capable of generating interpretable behavior is a
prerequisite for achieving effective human-robot collaboration. This means that
the robots need to be capable of generating behavior that aligns with human
expectations and, when required, provide explanations to the humans in the
loop. However, exhibiting such behavior in arbitrary environments could be
quite expensive for robots, and in some cases, the robot may not even be able
to exhibit the expected behavior. Given structured environments (like
warehouses and restaurants), it may be possible to design the environment so as
to boost the interpretability of the robot's behavior or to shape the human's
expectations of the robot's behavior. In this paper, we investigate the
opportunities and limitations of environment design as a tool to promote a type
of interpretable behavior -- known in the literature as explicable behavior. We
formulate a novel environment design framework that considers design over
multiple tasks and over a time horizon. In addition, we explore the
longitudinal aspect of explicable behavior and the trade-off that arises
between the cost of design and the cost of generating explicable behavior over
a time horizon.",2020-07-02,2020,2020-07,environment
"Natural Emergence of Heterogeneous Strategies in Artificially
  Intelligent Competitive Teams","Multi agent strategies in mixed cooperative-competitive environments can be
hard to craft by hand because each agent needs to coordinate with its teammates
while competing with its opponents. Learning based algorithms are appealing but
many scenarios require heterogeneous agent behavior for the team's success and
this increases the complexity of the learning algorithm. In this work, we
develop a competitive multi agent environment called FortAttack in which two
teams compete against each other. We corroborate that modeling agents with
Graph Neural Networks and training them with Reinforcement Learning leads to
the evolution of increasingly complex strategies for each team. We observe a
natural emergence of heterogeneous behavior amongst homogeneous agents when
such behavior can lead to the team's success. Such heterogeneous behavior from
homogeneous agents is appealing because any agent can replace the role of
another agent at test time. Finally, we propose ensemble training, in which we
utilize the evolved opponent strategies to train a single policy for friendly
agents.",2020-07-06,2020,2020-07,environment
Fast Adaptation via Policy-Dynamics Value Functions,"Standard RL algorithms assume fixed environment dynamics and require a
significant amount of interaction to adapt to new environments. We introduce
Policy-Dynamics Value Functions (PD-VF), a novel approach for rapidly adapting
to dynamics different from those previously seen in training. PD-VF explicitly
estimates the cumulative reward in a space of policies and environments. An
ensemble of conventional RL policies is used to gather experience on training
environments, from which embeddings of both policies and environments can be
learned. Then, a value function conditioned on both embeddings is trained. At
test time, a few actions are sufficient to infer the environment embedding,
enabling a policy to be selected by maximizing the learned value function
(which requires no additional environment interaction). We show that our method
can rapidly adapt to new dynamics on a set of MuJoCo domains. Code available at

particular problem and they generally have uninterpretable working processes.
Statistical methods-based agent algorithms can be improved in terms of
generalizability and interpretability using symbolic Artificial Intelligence
(AI) tools such as logic programming. In this study, we present a model-free RL
architecture that is supported with explicit relational representations of the
environmental objects. For the first time, we use the PrediNet network
architecture in a dynamic decision-making problem rather than image-based
tasks, and Multi-Head Dot-Product Attention Network (MHDPA) as a baseline for
performance comparisons. We tested two networks in two environments ---i.e.,
the baseline Box-World environment and our novel environment,
Relational-Grid-World (RGW). With the procedurally generated RGW environment,
which is complex in terms of visual perceptions and combinatorial selections,
it is easy to measure the relational representation performance of the RL
agents. The experiments were carried out using different configurations of the
environment so that the presented module and the environment were compared with
the baselines. We reached similar policy optimization performance results with
the PrediNet architecture and MHDPA; additionally, we achieved to extract the
propositional representation explicitly ---which makes the agent's statistical
policy logic more interpretable and tractable. This flexibility in the agent's
policy provides convenience for designing non-task-specific agent
architectures. The main contributions of this study are two-fold ---an RL agent

breed of IoT applications driven by artificial intelligence (AI), fog radio
access network (F-RAN) has been recently introduced for the fifth generation
(5G) wireless communications to overcome the latency limitations of cloud-RAN
(C-RAN). We consider the network slicing problem of allocating the limited
resources at the network edge (fog nodes) to vehicular and smart city users
with heterogeneous latency and computing demands in dynamic environments. We
develop a network slicing model based on a cluster of fog nodes (FNs)

reinforcement learning (DRL) solution to adaptively learn the optimal slicing
policy. The performance of the proposed DRL-based slicing method is evaluated
by comparing it with other slicing approaches in dynamic environments and for

Negotiating Team Formation Using Deep Reinforcement Learning,"When autonomous agents interact in the same environment, they must often
cooperate to achieve their goals. One way for agents to cooperate effectively

allocated appropriately to incentivize agreement. Various approaches for
multi-agent negotiation have been proposed, but typically only work for
particular negotiation protocols. More general methods usually require human
input or domain-specific data, and so do not scale. To address this, we propose
a framework for training agents to negotiate and form teams using deep
reinforcement learning. Importantly, our method makes no assumptions about the
specific negotiation protocol, and is instead completely experience driven. We

show that one can learn object-interaction tasks from scratch without
supervision by learning an attentive object-model as an auxiliary task during
task learning with an object-centric relational RL agent. Our key insight is
that learning an object-model that incorporates object-attention into forward
prediction provides a dense learning signal for unsupervised representation
learning of both objects and their relationships. This, in turn, enables faster
policy learning for an object-centric relational RL agent. We demonstrate our
agent by introducing a set of challenging object-interaction tasks in the
AI2Thor environment where learning with our attentive object-model is key to
strong performance. Specifically, we compare our agent and relational RL agents
with alternative auxiliary tasks to a relational RL agent equipped with
ground-truth object-information, and show that learning with our object-model
best closes the performance gap in terms of both learning speed and maximum

uncertainties. Meta-reinforcement learning addresses the efficiency and
generalization challenges on multi task learning by quickly leveraging the
meta-prior policy for a new task. In this paper, we propose a
meta-reinforcement learning approach to learn the dynamic model of a
non-stationary environment to be used for meta-policy optimization later. Due
to the sample efficiency of model-based learning methods, we are able to
simultaneously train both the meta-model of the non-stationary environment and
the meta-policy until dynamic model convergence. Then, the meta-learned dynamic
model of the environment will generate simulated data for meta-policy
optimization. Our experiment demonstrates that our proposed method can
meta-learn the policy in a non-stationary environment with the data efficiency
of model-based learning approaches while achieving the high asymptotic
performance of model-free meta-reinforcement learning.",2020-11-21,2020,2020-11,environment
On limitations of learning algorithms in competitive environments,"We discuss conceptual limitations of generic learning algorithms pursuing

"Robust Ultra-wideband Range Error Mitigation with Deep Learning at the
  Edge","Ultra-wideband (UWB) is the state-of-the-art and most popular technology for
wireless localization. Nevertheless, precise ranging and localization in
non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions is still an open research topic. Indeed,
multipath effects, reflections, refractions, and complexity of the indoor radio
environment can easily introduce a positive bias in the ranging measurement,
resulting in highly inaccurate and unsatisfactory position estimation. This
article proposes an efficient representation learning methodology that exploits
the latest advancement in deep learning and graph optimization techniques to
achieve effective ranging error mitigation at the edge. Channel Impulse
Response (CIR) signals are directly exploited to extract high semantic features
to estimate corrections in either NLoS or LoS conditions. Extensive
experimentation with different settings and configurations has proved the
effectiveness of our methodology and demonstrated the feasibility of a robust

"Emergent Complexity and Zero-shot Transfer via Unsupervised Environment
  Design","A wide range of reinforcement learning (RL) problems - including robustness,
transfer learning, unsupervised RL, and emergent complexity - require
specifying a distribution of tasks or environments in which a policy will be
trained. However, creating a useful distribution of environments is error
prone, and takes a significant amount of developer time and effort. We propose
Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) as an alternative paradigm, where
developers provide environments with unknown parameters, and these parameters
are used to automatically produce a distribution over valid, solvable
environments. Existing approaches to automatically generating environments
suffer from common failure modes: domain randomization cannot generate
structure or adapt the difficulty of the environment to the agent's learning
progress, and minimax adversarial training leads to worst-case environments
that are often unsolvable. To generate structured, solvable environments for
our protagonist agent, we introduce a second, antagonist agent that is allied
with the environment-generating adversary. The adversary is motivated to
generate environments which maximize regret, defined as the difference between
the protagonist and antagonist agent's return. We call our technique
Protagonist Antagonist Induced Regret Environment Design (PAIRED). Our
experiments demonstrate that PAIRED produces a natural curriculum of
increasingly complex environments, and PAIRED agents achieve higher zero-shot
transfer performance when tested in highly novel environments.",2020-12-03,2020,2020-12,environment
"Demonstration-efficient Inverse Reinforcement Learning in Procedurally
  Generated Environments","Deep Reinforcement Learning achieves very good results in domains where
reward functions can be manually engineered. At the same time, there is growing
interest within the community in using games based on Procedurally Content
Generation (PCG) as benchmark environments since this type of environment is
perfect for studying overfitting and generalization of agents under domain
shift. Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) can instead extrapolate reward
functions from expert demonstrations, with good results even on
high-dimensional problems, however there are no examples of applying these
techniques to procedurally-generated environments. This is mostly due to the
number of demonstrations needed to find a good reward model. We propose a
technique based on Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning which can
significantly decrease the need for expert demonstrations in PCG games. Through
the use of an environment with a limited set of initial seed levels, plus some
modifications to stabilize training, we show that our approach, DE-AIRL, is
demonstration-efficient and still able to extrapolate reward functions which
generalize to the fully procedural domain. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our technique on two procedural environments, MiniGrid and DeepCrawl, for a
variety of tasks.",2020-12-04,2020,2020-12,environment
"Generating Human-Like Movement: A Comparison Between Two Approaches
  Based on Environmental Features","Modelling realistic human behaviours in simulation is an ongoing challenge
that resides between several fields like social sciences, philosophy, and
artificial intelligence. Human movement is a special type of behaviour driven
by intent (e.g. to get groceries) and the surrounding environment (e.g.
curiosity to see new interesting places). Services available online and offline
do not normally consider the environment when planning a path, which is
decisive especially on a leisure trip. Two novel algorithms have been presented
to generate human-like trajectories based on environmental features. The
Attraction-Based A* algorithm includes in its computation information from the
environmental features meanwhile, the Feature-Based A* algorithm also injects
information from the real trajectories in its computation. The human-likeness
aspect has been tested by a human expert judging the final generated
trajectories as realistic. This paper presents a comparison between the two
approaches in some key metrics like efficiency, efficacy, and hyper-parameters
sensitivity. We show how, despite generating trajectories that are closer to

genetic programming concepts. On state-of-the-art learning environments, TPGs
have been shown to offer comparable competence with Deep Neural Networks

When Is Generalizable Reinforcement Learning Tractable?,"Agents trained by reinforcement learning (RL) often fail to generalize beyond
the environment they were trained in, even when presented with new scenarios
that seem similar to the training environment. We study the query complexity
required to train RL agents that generalize to multiple environments.
Intuitively, tractable generalization is only possible when the environments
are similar or close in some sense. To capture this, we introduce Weak
Proximity, a natural structural condition that requires the environments to
have highly similar transition and reward functions and share a policy
providing optimal value. Despite such shared structure, we prove that tractable
generalization is impossible in the worst case. This holds even when each
individual environment can be efficiently solved to obtain an optimal linear
policy, and when the agent possesses a generative model. Our lower bound
applies to the more complex task of representation learning for the purpose of
efficient generalization to multiple environments. On the positive side, we
introduce Strong Proximity, a strengthened condition which we prove is
sufficient for efficient generalization.",2021-01-01,2021,2021-01,environment
Impact of Explanation on Trust of a Novel Mobile Robot,"One challenge with introducing robots into novel environments is misalignment
between supervisor expectations and reality, which can greatly affect a user's
trust and continued use of the robot. We performed an experiment to test
whether the presence of an explanation of expected robot behavior affected a
supervisor's trust in an autonomous robot. We measured trust both subjectively
through surveys and objectively through a dual-task experiment design to
capture supervisors' neglect tolerance (i.e., their willingness to perform
their own task while the robot is acting autonomously). Our objective results
show that explanations can help counteract the novelty effect of seeing a new
robot perform in an unknown environment. Participants who received an
explanation of the robot's behavior were more likely to focus on their own task
at the risk of neglecting their robot supervision task during the first trials
of the robot's behavior compared to those who did not receive an explanation.
However, this effect diminished after seeing multiple trials, and participants
who received explanations were equally trusting of the robot's behavior as
those who did not receive explanations. Interestingly, participants were not
able to identify their own changes in trust through their survey responses,
demonstrating that the dual-task design measured subtler changes in a
supervisor's trust.",2021-01-26,2021,2021-01,environment

achieving state-of-the-art performance. Notably, MuZero uses internal state
representations derived from real environment states for its predictions. In
this paper, we bind the model's predicted internal state representation to the
environment state via two additional terms: a reconstruction model loss and a
simpler consistency loss, both of which work independently and unsupervised,
acting as constraints to stabilize the learning process. Our experiments show
that this new integration of reconstruction model loss and simpler consistency
loss provide a significant performance increase in OpenAI Gym environments. Our
modifications also enable self-supervised pretraining for MuZero, so the

Model-Based Offline Planning with Trajectory Pruning,"The recent offline reinforcement learning (RL) studies have achieved much

ingredients of offline RL with existing methods either provides
over-restrictive planning or leads to inferior performance. We propose a new
light-weighted model-based offline planning framework, namely MOPP, which
tackles the dilemma between the restrictions of offline learning and
high-performance planning. MOPP encourages more aggressive trajectory rollout

optimal regressor. This can, notably, lead to worse generalisation to new
environments, even compared with ERM which converges simply to the global
minimum for all training environments mixed up all together. We also highlight
the isseus of scaling in the the IRMv1 setup. These observations highlight the

generalization and performance in the current game state, how well the agent
would play in semantically similar environments, and a narrative explanation of
what the graphical information implies. We created a user-interface for our XAI

Vector Quantized Models for Planning,"Recent developments in the field of model-based RL have proven successful in
a range of environments, especially ones where planning is essential. However,
such successes have been limited to deterministic fully-observed environments.
We present a new approach that handles stochastic and partially-observable
environments. Our key insight is to use discrete autoencoders to capture the
multiple possible effects of an action in a stochastic environment. We use a
stochastic variant of Monte Carlo tree search to plan over both the agent's
actions and the discrete latent variables representing the environment's
response. Our approach significantly outperforms an offline version of MuZero

"Modelling resource allocation in uncertain system environment through
  deep reinforcement learning","Reinforcement Learning has applications in field of mechatronics, robotics,
and other resource-constrained control system. Problem of resource allocation
is primarily solved using traditional predefined techniques and modern deep

resource allocation is failing to meet the requirements in cases of uncertain
system environment. We can approach problem of resource allocation in uncertain
system environment alongside following certain criteria using deep
reinforcement learning. Also, reinforcement learning has ability for adapting
to new uncertain environment for prolonged period of time. The paper provides a
detailed comparative analysis on various deep reinforcement learning methods by
applying different components to modify architecture of reinforcement learning

"Scenic4RL: Programmatic Modeling and Generation of Reinforcement
  Learning Environments","The capability of a reinforcement learning (RL) agent heavily depends on the
diversity of the learning scenarios generated by the environment. Generation of
diverse realistic scenarios is challenging for real-time strategy (RTS)
environments. The RTS environments are characterized by intelligent
entities/non-RL agents cooperating and competing with the RL agents with large
state and action spaces over a long period of time, resulting in an infinite
space of feasible, but not necessarily realistic, scenarios involving complex
interaction among different RL and non-RL agents. Yet, most of the existing
simulators rely on randomly generating the environments based on predefined
settings/layouts and offer limited flexibility and control over the environment
dynamics for researchers to generate diverse, realistic scenarios as per their
demand. To address this issue, for the first time, we formally introduce the
benefits of adopting an existing formal scenario specification language,
SCENIC, to assist researchers to model and generate diverse scenarios in an RTS
environment in a flexible, systematic, and programmatic manner. To showcase the
benefits, we interfaced SCENIC to an existing RTS environment Google Research
Football(GRF) simulator and introduced a benchmark consisting of 32 realistic
scenarios, encoded in SCENIC, to train RL agents and testing their
generalization capabilities. We also show how researchers/RL practitioners can
incorporate their domain knowledge to expedite the training process by
intuitively modeling stochastic programmatic policies with SCENIC.",2021-06-18,2021,2021-06,environment
On the Importance of Environments in Human-Robot Coordination,"When studying robots collaborating with humans, much of the focus has been on
robot policies that coordinate fluently with human teammates in collaborative

diverse behaviors, we propose a framework for procedural generation of
environments that are (1) stylistically similar to human-authored environments,
(2) guaranteed to be solvable by the human-robot team, and (3) diverse with
respect to coordination measures. We analyze the procedurally generated
environments in the Overcooked benchmark domain via simulation and an online
user study. Results show that the environments result in qualitatively

Core Challenges in Embodied Vision-Language Planning,"Recent advances in the areas of multimodal machine learning and artificial
intelligence (AI) have led to the development of challenging tasks at the
intersection of Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Embodied AI.
Whereas many approaches and previous survey pursuits have characterised one or
two of these dimensions, there has not been a holistic analysis at the center
of all three. Moreover, even when combinations of these topics are considered,
more focus is placed on describing, e.g., current architectural methods, as
opposed to also illustrating high-level challenges and opportunities for the
field. In this survey paper, we discuss Embodied Vision-Language Planning
(EVLP) tasks, a family of prominent embodied navigation and manipulation
problems that jointly use computer vision and natural language. We propose a
taxonomy to unify these tasks and provide an in-depth analysis and comparison
of the new and current algorithmic approaches, metrics, simulated environments,

Classical Planning in Deep Latent Space,"Current domain-independent, classical planners require symbolic models of the

is incompatible with symbolic systems such as planners. We propose Latplan, an
unsupervised architecture combining deep learning and classical planning. Given
only an unlabeled set of image pairs showing a subset of transitions allowed in
the environment (training inputs), Latplan learns a complete propositional PDDL
action model of the environment. Later, when a pair of images representing the
initial and the goal states (planning inputs) is given, Latplan finds a plan to
the goal state in a symbolic latent space and returns a visualized plan
execution. We evaluate Latplan using image-based versions of 6 planning

"Policy Transfer across Visual and Dynamics Domain Gaps via Iterative
  Grounding","The ability to transfer a policy from one environment to another is a
promising avenue for efficient robot learning in realistic settings where task
supervision is not available. This can allow us to take advantage of
environments well suited for training, such as simulators or laboratories, to
learn a policy for a real robot in a home or office. To succeed, such policy
transfer must overcome both the visual domain gap (e.g. different illumination
or background) and the dynamics domain gap (e.g. different robot calibration or
modelling error) between source and target environments. However, prior policy
transfer approaches either cannot handle a large domain gap or can only address
one type of domain gap at a time. In this paper, we propose a novel policy
transfer method with iterative ""environment grounding"", IDAPT, that alternates
between (1) directly minimizing both visual and dynamics domain gaps by
grounding the source environment in the target environment domains, and (2)
training a policy on the grounded source environment. This iterative training
progressively aligns the domains between the two environments and adapts the
policy to the target environment. Once trained, the policy can be directly
executed on the target environment. The empirical results on locomotion and
robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that our approach can effectively
transfer a policy across visual and dynamics domain gaps with minimal
supervision and interaction with the target environment. Videos and code are

Collaborative Visual Navigation,"As a fundamental problem for Artificial Intelligence, multi-agent system
(MAS) is making rapid progress, mainly driven by multi-agent reinforcement

grid-world like or game environments; MAS in visually rich environments has
remained less explored. To narrow this gap and emphasize the crucial role of
perception in MAS, we propose a large-scale 3D dataset, CollaVN, for
multi-agent visual navigation (MAVN). In CollaVN, multiple agents are entailed
to cooperatively navigate across photo-realistic environments to reach target
locations. Diverse MAVN variants are explored to make our problem more general.
Moreover, a memory-augmented communication framework is proposed. Each agent is
equipped with a private, external memory to persistently store communication
information. This allows agents to make better use of their past communication
information, enabling more efficient collaboration and robust long-term
planning. In our experiments, several baselines and evaluation metrics are
designed. We also empirically verify the efficacy of our proposed MARL approach

"Multiclass Permanent Magnets Superstructure for Indoor Localization
  using Artificial Intelligence","Smartphones have become a popular tool for indoor localization and position
estimation of users. Existing solutions mainly employ Wi-Fi, RFID, and magnetic
sensing techniques to track movements in crowded venues. These are highly
sensitive to magnetic clutters and depend on local ambient magnetic fields,
which frequently degrades their performance. Also, these techniques often
require pre-known mapping surveys of the area, or the presence of active
beacons, which are not always available. We embed small-volume and large-moment
magnets in pre-known locations and arrange them in specific geometric
constellations that create magnetic superstructure patterns of supervised
magnetic signatures. These signatures constitute an unambiguous magnetic
environment with respect to the moving sensor carrier. The localization
algorithm learns the unique patterns of the scattered magnets during training
and detects them from the ongoing streaming of data during localization. Our
contribution is twofold. First, we deploy passive permanent magnets that do not
require a power supply, in contrast to active magnetic transmitters. Second, we
perform localization based on smartphone motion rather than on static
positioning of the magnetometer. In our previous study, we considered a single
superstructure pattern. Here, we present an extended version of that algorithm
for multi-superstructure localization, which covers a broader localization area

"Hindsight Value Function for Variance Reduction in Stochastic Dynamic

suffer from high variance of gradient estimate. To reduce the variance, the

variance of the gradient estimate for stochastic dynamic environments.
  Particularly, to obtain an ideally unbiased gradient estimate, we propose an
information-theoretic approach, which optimizes the embeddings of the future to
be independent of previous actions. In our experiments, we apply the proposed
hindsight value function in stochastic dynamic environments, including
discrete-action environments and continuous-action environments. Compared with
the standard state value function, the proposed hindsight value function
consistently reduces the variance, stabilizes the training, and improves the

"Indoor Localization Under Limited Measurements: A Cross-Environment

achieved via a sequence of operations that exploit the similarity across
environments to enhance unlabelled data model training of the desired
environment. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed
cross-environment approach outperforms the conventional method, convolutional
neural network (CNN), with a significant increase in localization accuracy, up
to 43%. Moreover, with only 40% data measurements, the proposed

the model to learn its environment and the right attitude against a problem as
the episodes pass. At the end, a model who has already learned a lot to solve a
path planning or routing problem in this environment is obtained and this model
can already find a nice and instant solution to a given unseen problem even
without any training. In routing problems, standard mathematical modeling or
heuristics seem to suffer from high computational time to find the solution and
it is also difficult and critical to find an instant solution. In this paper a
new solution method against these points is proposed and its efficiency is
proven experimentally.",2021-10-04,2021,2021-10,environment
"Towards Robust and Transferable IIoT Sensor based Anomaly Classification
  using Artificial Intelligence","The increasing deployment of low-cost industrial IoT (IIoT) sensor platforms
on industrial assets enables great opportunities for anomaly classification in
industrial plants. The performance of such a classification model depends
highly on the available training data. Models perform well when the training
data comes from the same machine. However, as soon as the machine is changed,
repaired, or put into operation in a different environment, the prediction
often fails. For this reason, we investigate whether it is feasible to have a
robust and transferable method for AI based anomaly classification using
different models and pre-processing steps on centrifugal pumps which are
dismantled and put back into operation in the same as well as in different
environments. Further, we investigate the model performance on different pumps
from the same type compared to those from the training data.",2021-10-07,2021,2021-10,environment
"Using Human-Guided Causal Knowledge for More Generalized Robot Task
  Planning","A major challenge in research involving artificial intelligence (AI) is the
development of algorithms that can find solutions to problems that can
generalize to different environments and tasks. Unlike AI, humans are adept at
finding solutions that can transfer. We hypothesize this is because their
solutions are informed by causal models. We propose to use human-guided causal
knowledge to help robots find solutions that can generalize to a new
environment. We develop and test the feasibility of a language interface that
na\""ive participants can use to communicate these causal models to a planner.
We find preliminary evidence that participants are able to use our interface
and generate causal models that achieve near-generalization. We outline an
experiment aimed at testing far-generalization using our interface and describe
our longer terms goals for these causal models.",2021-10-09,2021,2021-10,environment

"Planning from Pixels in Environments with Combinatorially Hard Search
  Spaces","The ability to form complex plans based on raw visual input is a litmus test
for current capabilities of artificial intelligence, as it requires a seamless
combination of visual processing and abstract algorithmic execution, two
traditionally separate areas of computer science. A recent surge of interest in
this field brought advances that yield good performance in tasks ranging from
arcade games to continuous control; these methods however do not come without
significant issues, such as limited generalization capabilities and
difficulties when dealing with combinatorially hard planning instances. Our
contribution is two-fold: (i) we present a method that learns to represent its
environment as a latent graph and leverages state reidentification to reduce
the complexity of finding a good policy from exponential to linear (ii) we
introduce a set of lightweight environments with an underlying discrete
combinatorial structure in which planning is challenging even for humans.
Moreover, we show that our methods achieves strong empirical generalization to
variations in the environment, even across highly disadvantaged regimes, such

low-quality trajectories.",2021-10-12,2021,2021-10,environment
"Extending Environments To Measure Self-Reflection In Reinforcement
  Learning","We consider an extended notion of reinforcement learning in which the
environment can simulate the agent and base its outputs on the agent's
hypothetical behavior. Since good performance usually requires paying attention
to whatever things the environment's outputs are based on, we argue that for an
agent to achieve on-average good performance across many such extended
environments, it is necessary for the agent to self-reflect. Thus
weighted-average performance over the space of all suitably well-behaved
extended environments could be considered a way of measuring how
self-reflective an agent is. We give examples of extended environments and
introduce a simple transformation which experimentally seems to increase some
standard RL agents' performance in a certain type of extended environment.",2021-10-13,2021,2021-10,environment

  The focus of motion planning research had been mainly on (i) improving the

"SILG: The Multi-environment Symbolic Interactive Language Grounding
  Benchmark","Existing work in language grounding typically study single environments. How
do we build unified models that apply across multiple environments? We propose
the multi-environment Symbolic Interactive Language Grounding benchmark (SILG),
which unifies a collection of diverse grounded language learning environments
under a common interface. SILG consists of grid-world environments that require
generalization to new dynamics, entities, and partially observed worlds (RTFM,
Messenger, NetHack), as well as symbolic counterparts of visual worlds that
require interpreting rich natural language with respect to complex scenes
(ALFWorld, Touchdown). Together, these environments provide diverse grounding
challenges in richness of observation space, action space, language
specification, and plan complexity. In addition, we propose the first shared
model architecture for RL on these environments, and evaluate recent advances
such as egocentric local convolution, recurrent state-tracking, entity-centric
attention, and pretrained LM using SILG. Our shared architecture achieves
comparable performance to environment-specific architectures. Moreover, we find
that many recent modelling advances do not result in significant gains on
environments other than the one they were designed for. This highlights the
need for a multi-environment benchmark. Finally, the best models significantly
underperform humans on SILG, which suggests ample room for future work. We hope
SILG enables the community to quickly identify new methodologies for language
grounding that generalize to a diverse set of environments and their associated
challenges.",2021-10-20,2021,2021-10,environment

Adaptability of Improved NEAT in Variable Environments,"A large challenge in Artificial Intelligence (AI) is training control agents
that can properly adapt to variable environments. Environments in which the

Building algorithms that can train agents to operate in these environments and
properly deal with the changing conditions is therefore important.
NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) was a novel Genetic Algorithm

This paper furthers the research on this subject by implementing various
versions of improved NEAT in a variable environment to determine if NEAT can
perform well in these environments. The improvements included, in every
combination, are: recurrent connections, automatic feature selection, and
increasing population size. The recurrent connections improvement performed
extremely well. The automatic feature selection improvement was found to be

  Transformers","The ability to adapt to changes in environmental contingencies is an
important challenge in reinforcement learning. Indeed, transferring previously
acquired knowledge to environments with unseen structural properties can
greatly enhance the flexibility and efficiency by which novel optimal policies
may be constructed. In this work, we study the problem of transfer learning
under changes in the environment dynamics. In this study, we apply causal
reasoning in the offline reinforcement learning setting to transfer a learned
policy to new environments. Specifically, we use the Decision Transformer (DT)
architecture to distill a new policy on the new environment. The DT is trained
on data collected by performing policy rollouts on factual and counterfactual

bootstrap a successful policy on the target environment while retaining most of

literature. In this paper, we carry out an empirical comparison of the
performance of independent algorithms on four PettingZoo environments that span
the three main categories of multi-agent environments, i.e., cooperative,
competitive, and mixed. We show that in fully-observable environments,
independent algorithms can perform on par with multi-agent algorithms in
cooperative and competitive settings. For the mixed environments, we show that
agents trained via independent algorithms learn to perform well individually,

Robust Deep Reinforcement Learning for Quadcopter Control,"Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has made it possible to solve complex
robotics problems using neural networks as function approximators. However, the
policies trained on stationary environments suffer in terms of generalization
when transferred from one environment to another. In this work, we use Robust
Markov Decision Processes (RMDP) to train the drone control policy, which
combines ideas from Robust Control and RL. It opts for pessimistic optimization
to handle potential gaps between policy transfer from one environment to
another. The trained control policy is tested on the task of quadcopter
positional control. RL agents were trained in a MuJoCo simulator. During
testing, different environment parameters (unseen during the training) were
used to validate the robustness of the trained policy for transfer from one
environment to another. The robust policy outperformed the standard agents in
these environments, suggesting that the added robustness increases generality
and can adapt to non-stationary environments.

increased in recent years. To enable access to personal data, Trusted Research
environments (TREs) provide safe and secure environments in which researchers

Machine Learning models. However currently few TREs support the use of
automated AI-based modelling using Machine Learning. Early attempts have been
made in the literature to present and introduce privacy preserving machine
learning from the design point of view [1]. However, there exists a gap in the
practical decision-making guidance for TREs in handling models disclosure.
Specifically, the use of machine learning creates a need to disclose new types

Therefore, this survey paper explores the methodologies proposed that can aid
doctors and researchers in early and inexpensive methods of diagnosis of the

Expert-Guided Symmetry Detection in Markov Decision Processes,"Learning a Markov Decision Process (MDP) from a fixed batch of trajectories
is a non-trivial task whose outcome's quality depends on both the amount and

are endowed with invariant reward and transition functions with respect to some
transformations of the current state and action. Being able to detect and
exploit these structures could benefit not only the learning of the MDP but
also the computation of its subsequent optimal control policy. In this work we
propose a paradigm, based on Density Estimation methods, that aims to detect
the presence of some already supposed transformations of the state-action space
for which the MDP dynamics is invariant. We tested the proposed approach in a
discrete toroidal grid environment and in two notorious environments of

stages: Offline learning of policies or utility functions for each potential
goal, and online inference. We provide a first instance of this framework using

end-to-end hazard analysis and design frame that includes the context of use,
impacted stakeholders and the formal and informal institutional environment in
which the system operates. Safety and other values are then inherently
socio-technical and emergent system properties that require design and control
measures to instantiate these across the technical, social and institutional
components of a system. This chapter honors system safety pioneer Nancy
Leveson, by situating her core lessons for today's AI system safety challenges.

"Towards a Responsible AI Development Lifecycle: Lessons From Information
  Security","Legislation and public sentiment throughout the world have promoted fairness
metrics, explainability, and interpretability as prescriptions for the
responsible development of ethical artificial intelligence systems. Despite the
importance of these three pillars in the foundation of the field, they can be
challenging to operationalize and attempts to solve the problems in production
environments often feel Sisyphean. This difficulty stems from a number of
factors: fairness metrics are computationally difficult to incorporate into
training and rarely alleviate all of the harms perpetrated by these systems.
Interpretability and explainability can be gamed to appear fair, may
inadvertently reduce the privacy of personal information contained in training
data, and increase user confidence in predictions -- even when the explanations
are wrong. In this work, we propose a framework for responsibly developing
artificial intelligence systems by incorporating lessons from the field of
information security and the secure development lifecycle to overcome
challenges associated with protecting users in adversarial settings. In
particular, we propose leveraging the concepts of threat modeling, design
review, penetration testing, and incident response in the context of developing
AI systems as ways to resolve shortcomings in the aforementioned methods.",2022-03-06,2022,2022-03,environment

present in a remote location virtually or via robotic avatars. Similarly, the
idea of operating a robot from a remote location for various tasks is called
teleoperation. These technologies find significant application in health care,
education, surveillance, disaster recovery, and corporate/government sectors.
But question still remains about their maturity, security and safety levels. We

"Artificial Intelligence in Vehicular Wireless Networks: A Case Study
  Using ns-3","Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have emerged as a powerful approach

optimization of wireless networks. Our pipeline consists of: (i) a new
geometry-based mobility-dependent channel model for V2X; (ii) all the layers of
a 5G-NR-compliant protocol stack, based on the ns3-mmwave module; (iii) a new
application to simulate V2X data transmission, and (iv) a new intelligent
entity for the control of the network via AI. Thanks to its flexible and
modular design, researchers can use this tool to implement, train, and evaluate
their own algorithms in a realistic and controlled environment. We test the
behavior of our framework in a Predictive Quality of Service (PQoS) scenario,

demonstrate that it promotes better network optimization compared to baseline
solutions that do not implement AI.",2022-03-10,2022,2022-03,environment
Context is Everything: Implicit Identification for Dynamics Adaptation,"Understanding environment dynamics is necessary for robots to act safely and
optimally in the world. In realistic scenarios, dynamics are non-stationary and
the causal variables such as environment parameters cannot necessarily be
precisely measured or inferred, even during training. We propose Implicit
Identification for Dynamics Adaptation (IIDA), a simple method to allow
predictive models to adapt to changing environment dynamics. IIDA assumes no
access to the true variations in the world and instead implicitly infers
properties of the environment from a small amount of contextual data. We
demonstrate IIDA's ability to perform well in unseen environments through a
suite of simulated experiments on MuJoCo environments and a real robot dynamic
sliding task. In general, IIDA significantly reduces model error and results in
higher task performance over commonly used methods. Our code and robot videos

ZIN: When and How to Learn Invariance Without Environment Partition?,"It is commonplace to encounter heterogeneous data, of which some aspects of
the data distribution may vary but the underlying causal mechanisms remain
constant. When data are divided into distinct environments according to the
heterogeneity, recent invariant learning methods have proposed to learn robust
and invariant models based on this environment partition. It is hence tempting
to utilize the inherent heterogeneity even when environment partition is not
provided. Unfortunately, in this work, we show that learning invariant features
under this circumstance is fundamentally impossible without further inductive
biases or additional information. Then, we propose a framework to jointly learn
environment partition and invariant representation, assisted by additional
auxiliary information. We derive sufficient and necessary conditions for our
framework to provably identify invariant features under a fairly general
setting. Experimental results on both synthetic and real world datasets
validate our analysis and demonstrate an improved performance of the proposed
framework over existing methods. Finally, our results also raise the need of
making the role of inductive biases more explicit in future works, when
considering learning invariant models without environment partition. Codes are

Explainability in reinforcement learning: perspective and position,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has been embedded into many aspects of people's
daily lives and it has become normal for people to have AI make decisions for
them. Reinforcement learning (RL) models increase the space of solvable
problems with respect to other machine learning paradigms. Some of the most
interesting applications are in situations with non-differentiable expected
reward function, operating in unknown or underdefined environment, as well as
for algorithmic discovery that surpasses performance of any teacher, whereby
agent learns from experimental experience through simple feedback. The range of
applications and their social impact is vast, just to name a few: genomics,
game-playing (chess, Go, etc.), general optimization, financial investment,
governmental policies, self-driving cars, recommendation systems, etc. It is
therefore essential to improve the trust and transparency of RL-based systems
through explanations. Most articles dealing with explainability in artificial
intelligence provide methods that concern supervised learning and there are
very few articles dealing with this in the area of RL. The reasons for this are
the credit assignment problem, delayed rewards, and the inability to assume
that data is independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.). This position
paper attempts to give a systematic overview of existing methods in the
explainable RL area and propose a novel unified taxonomy, building and
expanding on the existing ones. The position section describes pragmatic
aspects of how explainability can be observed. The gap between the parties
receiving and generating the explanation is especially emphasized. To reduce
the gap and achieve honesty and truthfulness of explanations, we set up three
pillars: proactivity, risk attitudes, and epistemological constraints. To this
end, we illustrate our proposal on simple variants of the shortest path

"The state-of-the-art review on resource allocation problem using

three paradigms, the cloud computing paradigm as an emerging technology adds
cloud layer services to the edge of the network so that resource allocation
operations occur close to the end-user to reduce resource processing time and
network traffic overhead. Hence, the resource allocation problem for its
providers in terms of presenting a suitable platform, by using computational
paradigms is considered a challenge. In general, resource allocation approaches
are divided into two methods, including auction-based methods(goal, increase
profits for service providers-increase user satisfaction and usability) and
optimization-based methods(energy, cost, network exploitation, Runtime,
reduction of time delay). In this paper, according to the latest scientific
achievements, a comprehensive literature study (CLS) on artificial intelligence

NovGrid: A Flexible Grid World for Evaluating Agent Response to Novelty,"A robust body of reinforcement learning techniques have been developed to
solve complex sequential decision making problems. However, these methods
assume that train and evaluation tasks come from similarly or identically
distributed environments. This assumption does not hold in real life where
small novel changes to the environment can make a previously learned policy
fail or introduce simpler solutions that might never be found. To that end we
explore the concept of {\em novelty}, defined in this work as the sudden change
to the mechanics or properties of environment. We provide an ontology of for
novelties most relevant to sequential decision making, which distinguishes
between novelties that affect objects versus actions, unary properties versus
non-unary relations, and the distribution of solutions to a task. We introduce
NovGrid, a novelty generation framework built on MiniGrid, acting as a toolkit
for rapidly developing and evaluating novelty-adaptation-enabled reinforcement
learning techniques. Along with the core NovGrid we provide exemplar novelties
aligned with our ontology and instantiate them as novelty templates that can be
applied to many MiniGrid-compliant environments. Finally, we present a set of
metrics built into our framework for the evaluation of
novelty-adaptation-enabled machine-learning techniques, and show
characteristics of a baseline RL model using these metrics.",2022-03-23,2022,2022-03,environment
EnvEdit: Environment Editing for Vision-and-Language Navigation,"In Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN), an agent needs to navigate through
the environment based on natural language instructions. Due to limited
available data for agent training and finite diversity in navigation
environments, it is challenging for the agent to generalize to new, unseen
environments. To address this problem, we propose EnvEdit, a data augmentation
method that creates new environments by editing existing environments, which
are used to train a more generalizable agent. Our augmented environments can
differ from the seen environments in three diverse aspects: style, object
appearance, and object classes. Training on these edit-augmented environments
prevents the agent from overfitting to existing environments and helps
generalize better to new, unseen environments. Empirically, on both the
Room-to-Room and the multi-lingual Room-Across-Room datasets, we show that our
proposed EnvEdit method gets significant improvements in all metrics on both
pre-trained and non-pre-trained VLN agents, and achieves the new
state-of-the-art on the test leaderboard. We further ensemble the VLN agents
augmented on different edited environments and show that these edit methods are
complementary. Code and data are available at

environments, we propose two federated RL algorithms, \texttt{QAvg} and
\texttt{PAvg}. We theoretically prove that these algorithms converge to
suboptimal solutions, while such suboptimality depends on how heterogeneous
these $n$ environments are. Moreover, we propose a heuristic that achieves

"Adaptive cognitive fit: Artificial intelligence augmented management of

applications have led to increasing pervasiveness of information facets and a
rapidly growing array of information representations. Information facets, such

perceptions of information and consequently affect human performance. Extant
research in cognitive fit, which preceded the big data and AI era, focused on
the effects of aligning information representation and task on performance,

"Stochastic Coherence Over Attention Trajectory For Continuous Learning
  In Video Streams","Devising intelligent agents able to live in an environment and learn by
observing the surroundings is a longstanding goal of Artificial Intelligence.
From a bare Machine Learning perspective, challenges arise when the agent is
prevented from leveraging large fully-annotated dataset, but rather the
interactions with supervisory signals are sparsely distributed over space and
time. This paper proposes a novel neural-network-based approach to
progressively and autonomously develop pixel-wise representations in a video
stream. The proposed method is based on a human-like attention mechanism that
allows the agent to learn by observing what is moving in the attended
locations. Spatio-temporal stochastic coherence along the attention trajectory,
paired with a contrastive term, leads to an unsupervised learning criterion
that naturally copes with the considered setting. Differently from most
existing works, the learned representations are used in open-set
class-incremental classification of each frame pixel, relying on few
supervisions. Our experiments leverage 3D virtual environments and they show
that the proposed agents can learn to distinguish objects just by observing the

Emergent Bartering Behaviour in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning,"Advances in artificial intelligence often stem from the development of new
environments that abstract real-world situations into a form where research can
be done conveniently. This paper contributes such an environment based on ideas
inspired by elementary Microeconomics. Agents learn to produce resources in a
spatially complex world, trade them with one another, and consume those that
they prefer. We show that the emergent production, consumption, and pricing
behaviors respond to environmental conditions in the directions predicted by
supply and demand shifts in Microeconomics. We also demonstrate settings where
the agents' emergent prices for goods vary over space, reflecting the local
abundance of goods. After the price disparities emerge, some agents then
discover a niche of transporting goods between regions with different
prevailing prices -- a profitable strategy because they can buy goods where
they are cheap and sell them where they are expensive. Finally, in a series of
ablation experiments, we investigate how choices in the environmental rewards,
bartering actions, agent architecture, and ability to consume tradable goods
can either aid or inhibit the emergence of this economic behavior. This work is
part of the environment development branch of a research program that aims to
build human-like artificial general intelligence through multi-agent
interactions in simulated societies. By exploring which environment features
are needed for the basic phenomena of elementary microeconomics to emerge

"Reinforcement Learning under Partial Observability Guided by Learned
  Environment Models","In practical applications, we can rarely assume full observability of a
system's environment, despite such knowledge being important for determining a
reactive control system's precise interaction with its environment. Therefore,
we propose an approach for reinforcement learning (RL) in partially observable
environments. While assuming that the environment behaves like a partially
observable Markov decision process with known discrete actions, we assume no
knowledge about its structure or transition probabilities.
  Our approach combines Q-learning with IoAlergia, a method for learning Markov
decision processes (MDP). By learning MDP models of the environment from
episodes of the RL agent, we enable RL in partially observable domains without
explicit, additional memory to track previous interactions for dealing with
ambiguities stemming from partial observability. We instead provide RL with
additional observations in the form of abstract environment states by
simulating new experiences on learned environment models to track the explored
states. In our evaluation, we report on the validity of our approach and its
promising performance in comparison to six state-of-the-art deep RL techniques
with recurrent neural networks and fixed memory.",2022-06-23,2022,2022-06,environment
"GAN-based Intrinsic Exploration For Sample Efficient Reinforcement

Intrinsic Reward Module that learns the distribution of the observed states and
sends an intrinsic reward that is computed as high for states that are out of
distribution, in order to lead agent to unexplored states. We evaluate our
approach in Super Mario Bros for a no reward setting and in Montezuma's Revenge
for a sparse reward setting and show that our approach is indeed capable of
exploring efficiently. We discuss a few weaknesses and conclude by discussing
future works.",2022-06-28,2022,2022-06,environment
USHER: Unbiased Sampling for Hindsight Experience Replay,"Dealing with sparse rewards is a long-standing challenge in reinforcement
learning (RL). Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) addresses this problem by
reusing failed trajectories for one goal as successful trajectories for
another. This allows for both a minimum density of reward and for
generalization across multiple goals. However, this strategy is known to result
in a biased value function, as the update rule underestimates the likelihood of
bad outcomes in a stochastic environment. We propose an asymptotically unbiased
importance-sampling-based algorithm to address this problem without sacrificing
performance on deterministic environments. We show its effectiveness on a range
of robotic systems, including challenging high dimensional stochastic
environments.",2022-07-03,2022,2022-07,environment
"AVDDPG: Federated reinforcement learning applied to autonomous platoon
  control","Since 2016 federated learning (FL) has been an evolving topic of discussion
in the artificial intelligence (AI) research community. Applications of FL led
to the development and study of federated reinforcement learning (FRL). Few
works exist on the topic of FRL applied to autonomous vehicle (AV) platoons. In
addition, most FRL works choose a single aggregation method (usually weight or
gradient aggregation). We explore FRL's effectiveness as a means to improve AV
platooning by designing and implementing an FRL framework atop a custom AV
platoon environment. The application of FRL in AV platooning is studied under
two scenarios: (1) Inter-platoon FRL (Inter-FRL) where FRL is applied to AVs
across different platoons; (2) Intra-platoon FRL (Intra-FRL) where FRL is
applied to AVs within a single platoon. Both Inter-FRL and Intra-FRL are
applied to a custom AV platooning environment using both gradient and weight
aggregation to observe the performance effects FRL can have on AV platoons
relative to an AV platooning environment trained without FRL. It is concluded
that Intra-FRL using weight aggregation (Intra-FRLWA) provides the best
performance for controlling an AV platoon. In addition, we found that weight
aggregation in FRL for AV platooning provides increases in performance relative
to gradient aggregation. Finally, a performance analysis is conducted for
Intra-FRLWA versus a platooning environment without FRL for platoons of length
3, 4 and 5 vehicles. It is concluded that Intra-FRLWA largely out-performs the
platooning environment that is trained without FRL.",2022-07-05,2022,2022-07,environment

Grounding Aleatoric Uncertainty for Unsupervised Environment Design,"Adaptive curricula in reinforcement learning (RL) have proven effective for
producing policies robust to discrepancies between the train and test
environment. Recently, the Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) framework
generalized RL curricula to generating sequences of entire environments,
leading to new methods with robust minimax regret properties. Problematically,
in partially-observable or stochastic settings, optimal policies may depend on
the ground-truth distribution over aleatoric parameters of the environment in
the intended deployment setting, while curriculum learning necessarily shifts
the training distribution. We formalize this phenomenon as curriculum-induced
covariate shift (CICS), and describe how its occurrence in aleatoric parameters
can lead to suboptimal policies. Directly sampling these parameters from the
ground-truth distribution avoids the issue, but thwarts curriculum learning. We
propose SAMPLR, a minimax regret UED method that optimizes the ground-truth
utility function, even when the underlying training data is biased due to CICS.
We prove, and validate on challenging domains, that our approach preserves
optimality under the ground-truth distribution, while promoting robustness
across the full range of environment settings.",2022-07-11,2022,2022-07,environment
GriddlyJS: A Web IDE for Reinforcement Learning,"Progress in reinforcement learning (RL) research is often driven by the
design of new, challenging environments -- a costly undertaking requiring
skills orthogonal to that of a typical machine learning researcher. The
complexity of environment development has only increased with the rise of
procedural-content generation (PCG) as the prevailing paradigm for producing
varied environments capable of testing the robustness and generalization of RL
agents. Moreover, existing environments often require complex build processes,
making reproducing results difficult. To address these issues, we introduce
GriddlyJS, a web-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) based on the
Griddly engine. GriddlyJS allows researchers to visually design and debug
arbitrary, complex PCG grid-world environments using a convenient graphical
interface, as well as visualize, evaluate, and record the performance of
trained agent models. By connecting the RL workflow to the advanced
functionality enabled by modern web standards, GriddlyJS allows publishing
interactive agent-environment demos that reproduce experimental results
directly to the web. To demonstrate the versatility of GriddlyJS, we use it to
quickly develop a complex compositional puzzle-solving environment alongside
arbitrary human-designed environment configurations and their solutions for use
in automatic curriculum learning and offline RL. The GriddlyJS IDE is open

"Brick Tic-Tac-Toe: Exploring the Generalizability of AlphaZero to Novel
  Test Environments","Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) environments typically are the same
for both the training and testing phases. Hence, current RL methods are largely
not generalizable to a test environment which is conceptually similar but
different from what the method has been trained on, which we term the novel
test environment. As an effort to push RL research towards algorithms which can
generalize to novel test environments, we introduce the Brick Tic-Tac-Toe
(BTTT) test bed, where the brick position in the test environment is different
from that in the training environment. Using a round-robin tournament on the
BTTT environment, we show that traditional RL state-search approaches such as
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and Minimax are more generalizable to novel test
environments than AlphaZero is. This is surprising because AlphaZero has been
shown to achieve superhuman performance in environments such as Go, Chess and
Shogi, which may lead one to think that it performs well in novel test
environments. Our results show that BTTT, though simple, is rich enough to
explore the generalizability of AlphaZero. We find that merely increasing MCTS
lookahead iterations was insufficient for AlphaZero to generalize to some novel
test environments. Rather, increasing the variety of training environments
helps to progressively improve generalizability across all possible starting
brick configurations.",2022-07-13,2022,2022-07,environment
"Evaluation of key impression of resilient supply chain based on
  artificial intelligence of things (AIoT)","In recent years, the high complexity of the business environment, dynamism
and environmental change, uncertainty and concepts such as globalization and
increasing competition of organizations in the national and international arena
have caused many changes in the equations governing the supply chain. In this
case, supply chain organizations must always be prepared for a variety of
challenges and dynamic environmental changes. One of the effective solutions to
face these challenges is to create a resilient supply chain. Resilient supply
chain is able to overcome uncertainties and disruptions in the business
environment. The competitive advantage of this supply chain does not depend
only on low costs, high quality, reduced latency and high level of service.
Rather, it has the ability of the chain to avoid catastrophes and overcome
critical situations, and this is the resilience of the supply chain. AI and IoT
technologies and their combination, called AIoT, have played a key role in
improving supply chain performance in recent years and can therefore increase
supply chain resilience. For this reason, in this study, an attempt was made to
better understand the impact of these technologies on equity by examining the
dimensions and components of the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT)-based
supply chain. Finally, using nonlinear fuzzy decision making method, the most
important components of the impact on the resilient smart supply chain are

"Core and Periphery as Closed-System Precepts for Engineering General
  Intelligence","Engineering methods are centered around traditional notions of decomposition
and recomposition that rely on partitioning the inputs and outputs of
components to allow for component-level properties to hold after their

expected to influence their environments, and, by way of their environments, to
influence themselves. Thus, it is unclear if an AI system's inputs will be
independent of its outputs, and, therefore, if AI systems can be treated as
traditional components. This paper posits that engineering general intelligence
requires new general systems precepts, termed the core and periphery, and
explores their theoretical uses. The new precepts are elaborated using abstract
systems theory and the Law of Requisite Variety. By using the presented

"Improving performance in multi-objective decision-making in Bottles
  environments with soft maximin approaches","Balancing multiple competing and conflicting objectives is an essential task
for any artificial intelligence tasked with satisfying human values or
preferences. Conflict arises both from misalignment between individuals with
competing values, but also between conflicting value systems held by a single
human. Starting with principle of loss-aversion, we designed a set of soft
maximin function approaches to multi-objective decision-making. Bench-marking
these functions in a set of previously-developed environments, we found that
one new approach in particular, 'split-function exp-log loss aversion'
(SFELLA), learns faster than the state of the art thresholded alignment
objective method (Vamplew et al, 2021) on three of four tasks it was tested on,
and achieved the same optimal performance after learning. SFELLA also showed
relative robustness improvements against changes in objective scale, which may
highlight an advantage dealing with distribution shifts in the environment
dynamics. Due to publishing rules, further work could not be presented in the
preprint, but in the final published version, we will further compare SFELLA to
the multi-objective reward exponentials (MORE) approach (Rolf, 2020),
demonstrating that SFELLA performs similarly to MORE in a simple
previously-described foraging task, but in a modified foraging environment with
a new resource that was not depleted as the agent worked, SFELLA collected more
of the new resource with very little cost incurred in terms of the old

"Artificial Intelligence Empowered Multiple Access for Ultra Reliable and

line-of-sight demand of THz links, as well as the ultra-dense deployment of THz
networks, a number of challenges that the medium access control (MAC) layer

association and resource allocation strategies by incorporating artificial
intelligence (AI) capable of providing ""real-time"" solutions in complex and
frequently changing environments becomes evident. Moreover, to satisfy the
ultra-reliability and low-latency demands of several B5G applications, novel

presents a holistic MAC layer approach that enables intelligent user
association and resource allocation, as well as flexible and adaptive mobility
management, while maximizing systems' reliability through blockage
minimization. In more detail, a fast and centralized joint user association,
radio resource allocation, and blockage avoidance by means of a novel
metaheuristic-machine learning framework is documented, that maximizes the THz
networks performance, while minimizing the association latency by approximately
three orders of magnitude. To support, within the access point (AP) coverage
area, mobility management and blockage avoidance, a deep reinforcement learning

"Ask Before You Act: Generalising to Novel Environments by Asking
  Questions","Solving temporally-extended tasks is a challenge for most reinforcement
learning (RL) algorithms [arXiv:1906.07343]. We investigate the ability of an
RL agent to learn to ask natural language questions as a tool to understand its
environment and achieve greater generalisation performance in novel,
temporally-extended environments. We do this by endowing this agent with the
ability of asking ""yes-no"" questions to an all-knowing Oracle. This allows the
agent to obtain guidance regarding the task at hand, while limiting the access
to new information. To study the emergence of such natural language questions
in the context of temporally-extended tasks we first train our agent in a
Mini-Grid environment. We then transfer the trained agent to a different,
harder environment. We observe a significant increase in generalisation
performance compared to a baseline agent unable to ask questions. Through
grounding its understanding of natural language in its environment, the agent
can reason about the dynamics of its environment to the point that it can ask
new, relevant questions when deployed in a novel environment.",2022-09-10,2022,2022-09,environment
Extended Intelligence,"We argue that intelligence, construed as the disposition to perform tasks

Hence, this disposition is not possessed by an agent alone, but is rather
possessed by the system consisting of an agent and its context, which we dub an
agent-in-context. An agent's context may include an environment, other agents,
cultural artifacts (like language, technology), or all of these, as is
typically the case for humans and artificial intelligence systems, as well as
many non-human animals. In virtue of the thesis of extended intelligence, we

Improving Policy Learning via Language Dynamics Distillation,"Recent work has shown that augmenting environments with language descriptions
improves policy learning. However, for environments with complex language
abstractions, learning how to ground language to observations is difficult due
to sparse, delayed rewards. We propose Language Dynamics Distillation (LDD),
which pretrains a model to predict environment dynamics given demonstrations
with language descriptions, and then fine-tunes these language-aware pretrained
representations via reinforcement learning (RL). In this way, the model is
trained to both maximize expected reward and retain knowledge about how
language relates to environment dynamics. On SILG, a benchmark of five tasks
with language descriptions that evaluate distinct generalization challenges on
unseen environments (NetHack, ALFWorld, RTFM, Messenger, and Touchdown), LDD
outperforms tabula-rasa RL, VAE pretraining, and methods that learn from

"Neuro-symbolic Explainable Artificial Intelligence Twin for Zero-touch
  IoE in Wireless Network","Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) twin systems will be a fundamental
enabler of zero-touch network and service management (ZSM) for sixth-generation
(6G) wireless networks. A reliable XAI twin system for ZSM requires two
composites: an extreme analytical ability for discretizing the physical
behavior of the Internet of Everything (IoE) and rigorous methods for
characterizing the reasoning of such behavior. In this paper, a novel
neuro-symbolic explainable artificial intelligence twin framework is proposed
to enable trustworthy ZSM for a wireless IoE. The physical space of the XAI
twin executes a neural-network-driven multivariate regression to capture the
time-dependent wireless IoE environment while determining unconscious decisions
of IoE service aggregation. Subsequently, the virtual space of the XAI twin
constructs a directed acyclic graph (DAG)-based Bayesian network that can infer
a symbolic reasoning score over unconscious decisions through a first-order
probabilistic language model. Furthermore, a Bayesian multi-arm bandits-based
learning problem is proposed for reducing the gap between the expected
explained score and the current obtained score of the proposed neuro-symbolic
XAI twin. To address the challenges of extensible, modular, and stateless
management functions in ZSM, the proposed neuro-symbolic XAI twin framework
consists of two learning systems: 1) an implicit learner that acts as an
unconscious learner in physical space, and 2) an explicit leaner that can
exploit symbolic reasoning based on implicit learner decisions and prior
evidence. Experimental results show that the proposed neuro-symbolic XAI twin

generative models that are pretrained on static datasets and introduce a
dynamic model in the latent space. The transition dynamics simply mixes an
action and a random sampled latent. It then applies an exponential moving
average for temporal persistency, the resulting latent is decoded to image
using pretrained generator. We then employ an unsupervised reinforcement
learning algorithm to explore in this environment and perform unsupervised
representation learning on the collected data. We further leverage the temporal

transparent models and decisions, which are easy to understand, analyze, and
augment by a non-technical audience. Fuzzy Logic Systems (FLS) based XAI can
provide an explainable framework, while also modeling uncertainties present in
real-world environments, which renders it suitable for applications where
explainability is a requirement. However, most real-life processes are not
characterized by high levels of uncertainties alone; they are inherently
time-dependent as well, i.e., the processes change with time. In this work, we
present novel Temporal Type-2 FLS Based Approach for time-dependent XAI (TXAI)
systems, which can account for the likelihood of a measurement's occurrence in
the time domain using (the measurement's) frequency of occurrence. In Temporal
Type-2 Fuzzy Sets (TT2FSs), a four-dimensional (4D) time-dependent membership
function is developed where relations are used to construct the inter-relations
between the elements of the universe of discourse and its frequency of
occurrence. The TXAI system manifested better classification prowess, with
10-fold test datasets, with a mean recall of 95.40\% than a standard XAI system
(based on non-temporal general type-2 (GT2) fuzzy sets) that had a mean recall
of 87.04\%. TXAI also performed significantly better than most non-explainable
AI systems between 3.95\%, to 19.04\% improvement gain in mean recall. In
addition, TXAI can also outline the most likely time-dependent trajectories
using the frequency of occurrence values embedded in the TXAI model; viz. given
a rule at a determined time interval, what will be the next most likely rule at
a subsequent time interval. In this regard, the proposed TXAI system can have
profound implications for delineating the evolution of real-life time-dependent
processes, such as behavioural or biological processes.",2022-10-22,2022,2022-10,environment
MetaSpeech: Speech Effects Switch Along with Environment for Metaverse,"Metaverse expands the physical world to a new dimension, and the physical
environment and Metaverse environment can be directly connected and entered.
Voice is an indispensable communication medium in the real world and Metaverse.
Fusion of the voice with environment effects is important for user immersion in
Metaverse. In this paper, we proposed using the voice conversion based method
for the conversion of target environment effect speech. The proposed method was
named MetaSpeech, which introduces an environment effect module containing an
effect extractor to extract the environment information and an effect encoder
to encode the environment effect condition, in which gradient reversal layer
was used for adversarial training to keep the speech content and speaker
information while disentangling the environmental effects. From the experiment
results on the public dataset of LJSpeech with four environment effects, the
proposed model could complete the specific environment effect conversion and
outperforms the baseline methods from the voice conversion task.",2022-10-25,2022,2022-10,environment
"Multi-Environment based Meta-Learning with CSI Fingerprints for Radio
  Based Positioning","Radio based positioning of a user equipment (UE) based on deep learning (DL)
methods using channel state information (CSI) fingerprints have shown promising
results. DL models are able to capture complex properties embedded in the CSI
about a particular environment and map UE's CSI to the UE's position. However,
the CSI fingerprints and the DL models trained on such fingerprints are highly
dependent on a particular propagation environment, which generally limits the
transfer of knowledge of the DL models from one environment to another. In this
paper, we propose a DL model consisting of two parts: the first part aims to
learn environment independent features while the second part combines those
features depending on the particular environment. To improve transfer learning,
we propose a meta learning scheme for training the first part over multiple
environments. We show that for positioning in a new environment, initializing a
DL model with the meta learned environment independent function achieves higher
UE positioning accuracy compared to regular transfer learning from one
environment to the new environment, or compared to training the DL model from
scratch with only fingerprints from the new environment. Our proposed scheme is
able to create an environment independent function which can embed knowledge
from multiple environments and more effectively learn from a new environment.",2022-10-26,2022,2022-10,environment
Environment Design for Inverse Reinforcement Learning,"Learning a reward function from demonstrations suffers from low
sample-efficiency. Even with abundant data, current inverse reinforcement
learning methods that focus on learning from a single environment can fail to
handle slight changes in the environment dynamics. We tackle these challenges
through adaptive environment design. In our framework, the learner repeatedly
interacts with the expert, with the former selecting environments to identify
the reward function as quickly as possible from the expert's demonstrations in
said environments. This results in improvements in both sample-efficiency and
robustness, as we show experimentally, for both exact and approximate
inference.",2022-10-26,2022,2022-10,environment
"Distributed Swarm Learning for Internet of Things at the Edge: Where
  Artificial Intelligence Meets Biological Intelligence","With the proliferation of versatile Internet of Things (IoT) services, smart
IoT devices are increasingly deployed at the edge of wireless networks to

"Examining the Differential Risk from High-level Artificial Intelligence
  and the Question of Control","Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the most transformative technologies
of the 21st century. The extent and scope of future AI capabilities remain a
key uncertainty, with widespread disagreement on timelines and potential
impacts. As nations and technology companies race toward greater complexity and
autonomy in AI systems, there are concerns over the extent of integration and
oversight of opaque AI decision processes. This is especially true in the
subfield of machine learning (ML), where systems learn to optimize objectives
without human assistance. Objectives can be imperfectly specified or executed
in an unexpected or potentially harmful way. This becomes more concerning as
systems increase in power and autonomy, where an abrupt capability jump could
result in unexpected shifts in power dynamics or even catastrophic failures.
This study presents a hierarchical complex systems framework to model AI risk
and provide a template for alternative futures analysis. Survey data were
collected from domain experts in the public and private sectors to classify AI
impact and likelihood. The results show increased uncertainty over the powerful
AI agent scenario, confidence in multiagent environments, and increased concern

"Max-Min Off-Policy Actor-Critic Method Focusing on Worst-Case Robustness
  to Model Misspecification","In the field of reinforcement learning, because of the high cost and risk of
policy training in the real world, policies are trained in a simulation
environment and transferred to the corresponding real-world environment.
However, the simulation environment does not perfectly mimic the real-world
environment, lead to model misspecification. Multiple studies report
significant deterioration of policy performance in a real-world environment. In
this study, we focus on scenarios involving a simulation environment with
uncertainty parameters and the set of their possible values, called the
uncertainty parameter set. The aim is to optimize the worst-case performance on
the uncertainty parameter set to guarantee the performance in the corresponding
real-world environment. To obtain a policy for the optimization, we propose an
off-policy actor-critic approach called the Max-Min Twin Delayed Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm (M2TD3), which solves a max-min
optimization problem using a simultaneous gradient ascent descent approach.
Experiments in multi-joint dynamics with contact (MuJoCo) environments show

Foundation Models for Semantic Novelty in Reinforcement Learning,"Effectively exploring the environment is a key challenge in reinforcement

visual-language knowledge about the world. Specifically, our intrinsic reward
is defined based on pre-trained CLIP embeddings without any fine-tuning or
learning on the target RL task. We demonstrate that CLIP-based intrinsic

"Towards a Dynamic Composability Approach for using Heterogeneous Systems
  in Remote Sensing","Influenced by the advances in data and computing, the scientific practice
increasingly involves machine learning and artificial intelligence driven
methods which requires specialized capabilities at the system-, science- and
service-level in addition to the conventional large-capacity supercomputing
approaches. The latest distributed architectures built around the composability
of data-centric applications led to the emergence of a new ecosystem for
container coordination and integration. However, there is still a divide
between the application development pipelines of existing supercomputing
environments, and these new dynamic environments that disaggregate fluid
resource pools through accessible, portable and re-programmable interfaces. New
approaches for dynamic composability of heterogeneous systems are needed to
further advance the data-driven scientific practice for the purpose of more
efficient computing and usable tools for specific scientific domains. In this
paper, we present a novel approach for using composable systems in the
intersection between scientific computing, artificial intelligence (AI), and
remote sensing domain. We describe the architecture of a first working example
of a composable infrastructure that federates Expanse, an NSF-funded
supercomputer, with Nautilus, a Kubernetes-based GPU geo-distributed cluster.
We also summarize a case study in wildfire modeling, that demonstrates the
application of this new infrastructure in scientific workflows: a composed

capabilities with a physics-driven simulation.",2022-11-13,2022,2022-11,environment
"Understanding the Energy Consumption of HPC Scale Artificial

"Discrete Control in Real-World Driving Environments using Deep
  Reinforcement Learning","Training self-driving cars is often challenging since they require a vast
amount of labeled data in multiple real-world contexts, which is
computationally and memory intensive. Researchers often resort to driving
simulators to train the agent and transfer the knowledge to a real-world
setting. Since simulators lack realistic behavior, these methods are quite
inefficient. To address this issue, we introduce a framework (perception,
planning, and control) in a real-world driving environment that transfers the
real-world environments into gaming environments by setting up a reliable
Markov Decision Process (MDP). We propose variations of existing Reinforcement
Learning (RL) algorithms in a multi-agent setting to learn and execute the
discrete control in real-world environments. Experiments show that the
multi-agent setting outperforms the single-agent setting in all the scenarios.
We also propose reliable initialization, data augmentation, and training
techniques that enable the agents to learn and generalize to navigate in a
real-world environment with minimal input video data, and with minimal

deploy our method in the virtual driving environment TORCS.",2022-11-29,2022,2022-11,environment

our own reinforcement learning agent environment, ""the Room"", where an agent
has to learn how to encode, store, and retrieve memories to maximize its return

Simulation of Attacker Defender Interaction in a Noisy Security Game,"In the cybersecurity setting, defenders are often at the mercy of their
detection technologies and subject to the information and experiences that
individual analysts have. In order to give defenders an advantage, it is
important to understand an attacker's motivation and their likely next best
action. As a first step in modeling this behavior, we introduce a security game
framework that simulates interplay between attackers and defenders in a noisy
environment, focusing on the factors that drive decision making for attackers
and defenders in the variants of the game with full knowledge and
observability, knowledge of the parameters but no observability of the state
(``partial knowledge''), and zero knowledge or observability (``zero
knowledge''). We demonstrate the importance of making the right assumptions
about attackers, given significant differences in outcomes. Furthermore, there
is a measurable trade-off between false-positives and true-positives in terms
of attacker outcomes, suggesting that a more false-positive prone environment
may be acceptable under conditions where true-positives are also higher.",2022-12-08,2022,2022-12,environment
"MixBoost: Improving the Robustness of Deep Neural Networks by Boosting
  Data Augmentation","As more and more artificial intelligence (AI) technologies move from the
laboratory to real-world applications, the open-set and robustness challenges
brought by data from the real world have received increasing attention. Data
augmentation is a widely used method to improve model performance, and some
recent works have also confirmed its positive effect on the robustness of AI
models. However, most of the existing data augmentation methods are heuristic,
lacking the exploration of their internal mechanisms. We apply the explainable
artificial intelligence (XAI) method, explore the internal mechanisms of
popular data augmentation methods, analyze the relationship between game
interactions and some widely used robustness metrics, and propose a new proxy
for model robustness in the open-set environment. Based on the analysis of the
internal mechanisms, we develop a mask-based boosting method for data
augmentation that comprehensively improves several robustness measures of AI
models and beats state-of-the-art data augmentation approaches. Experiments
show that our method can be widely applied to many popular data augmentation
methods. Different from the adversarial training, our boosting method not only
significantly improves the robustness of models, but also improves the accuracy

reinforcement learning policies by exploiting quantum interactions with an
environment. However, these algorithms only offer full quadratic speed-ups in

Decision-making and control with diffractive optical networks,"The ultimate goal of artificial intelligence is to mimic the human brain to
perform decision-making and control directly from high-dimensional sensory
input. Diffractive optical networks provide a promising solution for
implementing artificial intelligence with high-speed and low-power consumption.
Most of the reported diffractive optical networks focus on single or multiple
tasks that do not involve environmental interaction, such as object recognition
and image classification. In contrast, the networks capable of performing
decision-making and control have not yet been developed to our knowledge. Here,
we propose using deep reinforcement learning to implement diffractive optical
networks that imitate human-level decision-making and control capability. Such
networks taking advantage of a residual architecture, allow for finding optimal
control policies through interaction with the environment and can be readily
implemented with existing optical devices. The superior performance of these
networks is verified by engaging three types of classic games, Tic-Tac-Toe,
Super Mario Bros., and Car Racing. Finally, we present an experimental

reducing the proportion of supervised training, we introduce the Paired
Transformed Autoencoders (PTAE) model, using Transformer-based crossmodal
attention. PTAE achieves significantly higher accuracy in language-to-action

cases when only few supervised training samples are available. We also test
whether the trained model behaves realistically with conflicting multimodal
input. In accordance with the concept of incongruence in psychology, conflict
deteriorates the model output. Conflicting action input has a more severe

"Graph based Environment Representation for Vision-and-Language
  Navigation in Continuous Environments","Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) is a
navigation task that requires an agent to follow a language instruction in a
realistic environment. The understanding of environments is a crucial part of
the VLN-CE task, but existing methods are relatively simple and direct in
understanding the environment, without delving into the relationship between
language instructions and visual environments. Therefore, we propose a new
environment representation in order to solve the above problems. First, we
propose an Environment Representation Graph (ERG) through object detection to
express the environment in semantic level. This operation enhances the
relationship between language and environment. Then, the relational
representations of object-object, object-agent in ERG are learned through GCN,
so as to obtain a continuous expression about ERG. Sequentially, we combine the
ERG expression with object label embeddings to obtain the environment

"Generalization through Diversity: Improving Unsupervised Environment
  Design","Agent decision making using Reinforcement Learning (RL) heavily relies on
either a model or simulator of the environment (e.g., moving in an 8x8 maze
with three rooms, playing Chess on an 8x8 board). Due to this dependence, small
changes in the environment (e.g., positions of obstacles in the maze, size of
the board) can severely affect the effectiveness of the policy learned by the
agent. To that end, existing work has proposed training RL agents on an
adaptive curriculum of environments (generated automatically) to improve
performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) test scenarios. Specifically, existing
research has employed the potential for the agent to learn in an environment
(captured using Generalized Advantage Estimation, GAE) as the key factor to
select the next environment(s) to train the agent. However, such a mechanism
can select similar environments (with a high potential to learn) thereby making
agent training redundant on all but one of those environments. To that end, we
provide a principled approach to adaptively identify diverse environments based

we find that these baseline results are below human-level performance. We then
provide a new classical planning heuristic that solves the most puzzles among
the baselines, and although it is 40 times faster than the best baseline
planner, it remains below human-level performance.",2023-01-24,2023,2023-01,environment
"Effective Baselines for Multiple Object Rearrangement Planning in
  Partially Observable Mapped Environments","Many real-world tasks, from house-cleaning to cooking, can be formulated as
multi-object rearrangement problems -- where an agent needs to get specific
objects into appropriate goal states. For such problems, we focus on the
setting that assumes a pre-specified goal state, availability of perfect
manipulation and object recognition capabilities, and a static map of the
environment but unknown initial location of objects to be rearranged. Our goal
is to enable home-assistive intelligent agents to efficiently plan for
rearrangement under such partial observability. This requires efficient
trade-offs between exploration of the environment and planning for
rearrangement, which is challenging because of long-horizon nature of the
problem. To make progress on this problem, we first analyze the effects of
various factors such as number of objects and receptacles, agent carrying
capacity, environment layouts etc. on exploration and planning for
rearrangement using classical methods. We then investigate both monolithic and
modular deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods for planning in our setting.
We find that monolithic DRL methods do not succeed at long-horizon planning
needed for multi-object rearrangement. Instead, modular greedy approaches
surprisingly perform reasonably well and emerge as competitive baselines for
planning with partial observability in multi-object rearrangement problems. We
also show that our greedy modular agents are empirically optimal when the
objects that need to be rearranged are uniformly distributed in the environment
-- thereby contributing baselines with strong performance for future work on
multi-object rearrangement planning in partially observable settings.",2023-01-24,2023,2023-01,environment

different architectures to easily interact with the Minecraft world, train and
be evaluated in multiple tasks. PAL enables the creation of tasks in a flexible

"DiSProD: Differentiable Symbolic Propagation of Distributions for
  Planning","The paper introduces DiSProD, an online planner developed for environments
with probabilistic transitions in continuous state and action spaces. DiSProD
builds a symbolic graph that captures the distribution of future trajectories,
conditioned on a given policy, using independence assumptions and approximate
propagation of distributions. The symbolic graph provides a differentiable
representation of the policy's value, enabling efficient gradient-based
optimization for long-horizon search. The propagation of approximate
distributions can be seen as an aggregation of many trajectories, making it
well-suited for dealing with sparse rewards and stochastic environments. An
extensive experimental evaluation compares DiSProD to state-of-the-art planners
in discrete-time planning and real-time control of robotic systems. The
proposed method improves over existing planners in handling stochastic
environments, sensitivity to search depth, sparsity of rewards, and large
action spaces. Additional real-world experiments demonstrate that DiSProD can
control ground vehicles and surface vessels to successfully navigate around
obstacles.",2023-02-03,2023,2023-02,environment
Diversity Induced Environment Design via Self-Play,"Recent work on designing an appropriate distribution of environments has
shown promise for training effective generally capable agents. Its success is
partly because of a form of adaptive curriculum learning that generates
environment instances (or levels) at the frontier of the agent's capabilities.
However, such an environment design framework often struggles to find effective
levels in challenging design spaces and requires costly interactions with the
environment. In this paper, we aim to introduce diversity in the Unsupervised
Environment Design (UED) framework. Specifically, we propose a task-agnostic
method to identify observed/hidden states that are representative of a given
level. The outcome of this method is then utilized to characterize the
diversity between two levels, which as we show can be crucial to effective
performance. In addition, to improve sampling efficiency, we incorporate the
self-play technique that allows the environment generator to automatically
generate environments that are of great benefit to the training agent.
Quantitatively, our approach, Diversity-induced Environment Design via
Self-Play (DivSP), shows compelling performance over existing methods.",2023-02-04,2023,2023-02,environment

"Understanding Policy and Technical Aspects of AI-Enabled Smart Video
  Surveillance to Address Public Safety","Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have seen the emergence
of smart video surveillance (SVS) in many practical applications, particularly
for building safer and more secure communities in our urban environments.
Cognitive tasks, such as identifying objects, recognizing actions, and
detecting anomalous behaviors, can produce data capable of providing valuable
insights to the community through statistical and analytical tools. However,
artificially intelligent surveillance systems design requires special
considerations for ethical challenges and concerns. The use and storage of
personally identifiable information (PII) commonly pose an increased risk to
personal privacy. To address these issues, this paper identifies the privacy
concerns and requirements needed to address when designing AI-enabled smart
video surveillance. Further, we propose the first end-to-end AI-enabled
privacy-preserving smart video surveillance system that holistically combines
computer vision analytics, statistical data analytics, cloud-native services,
and end-user applications. Finally, we propose quantitative and qualitative
metrics to evaluate intelligent video surveillance systems. The system shows
the 17.8 frame-per-second (FPS) processing in extreme video scenes. However,
considering privacy in designing such a system results in preferring the
pose-based algorithm to the pixel-based one. This choice resulted in dropping
accuracy in both action and anomaly detection tasks. The results drop from
97.48 to 73.72 in anomaly detection and 96 to 83.07 in the action detection
task. On average, the latency of the end-to-end system is 36.1 seconds.",2023-02-08,2023,2023-02,environment
Zero-shot Sim2Real Adaptation Across Environments,"Simulation based learning often provides a cost-efficient recourse to
reinforcement learning applications in robotics. However, simulators are
generally incapable of accurately replicating real-world dynamics, and thus
bridging the sim2real gap is an important problem in simulation based learning.
Current solutions to bridge the sim2real gap involve hybrid simulators that are
augmented with neural residual models. Unfortunately, they require a separate
residual model for each individual environment configuration (i.e., a fixed
setting of environment variables such as mass, friction etc.), and thus are not
transferable to new environments quickly. To address this issue, we propose a
Reverse Action Transformation (RAT) policy which learns to imitate simulated
policies in the real-world. Once learnt from a single environment, RAT can then
be deployed on top of a Universal Policy Network to achieve zero-shot
adaptation to new environments. We empirically evaluate our approach in a set
of continuous control tasks and observe its advantage as a few-shot and
zero-shot learner over competing baselines.",2023-02-08,2023,2023-02,environment

"Signifiers as a First-class Abstraction in Hypermedia Multi-Agent
  Systems","Hypermedia APIs enable the design of reusable hypermedia clients that
discover and exploit affordances on the Web. However, the reusability of such
clients remains limited since they cannot plan and reason about interaction.
This paper provides a conceptual bridge between hypermedia-driven affordance
exploitation on the Web and methods for representing and reasoning about
actions that have been extensively explored for Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and,
more broadly, Artificial Intelligence. We build on concepts and methods from
Affordance Theory and Human-Computer Interaction that support interaction
efficiency in open and evolvable environments to introduce signifiers as a
first-class abstraction in Web-based MAS: Signifiers are designed with respect
to the agent-environment context of their usage and enable agents with
heterogeneous abilities to act and to reason about action. We define a formal
model for the contextual exposure of signifiers in hypermedia environments that
aims to drive affordance exploitation. We demonstrate our approach with a
prototypical Web-based MAS where two agents with different reasoning abilities
proactively discover how to interact with their environment by perceiving only
the signifiers that fit their abilities. We show that signifier exposure can be
inherently managed based on the dynamic agent-environment context towards
facilitating effective and efficient interactions on the Web.",2023-02-14,2023,2023-02,environment
"Grounding Complex Natural Language Commands for Temporal Tasks in Unseen
  Environments","Grounding navigational commands to linear temporal logic (LTL) leverages its
unambiguous semantics for reasoning about long-horizon tasks and verifying the
satisfaction of temporal constraints. Existing approaches require training data

Characterizing Novelty in the Military Domain,"A critical factor in utilizing agents with Artificial Intelligence (AI) is
their robustness to novelty. AI agents include models that are either
engineered or trained. Engineered models include knowledge of those aspects of
the environment that are known and considered important by the engineers.
Learned models form embeddings of aspects of the environment based on
connections made through the training data. In operation, however, a rich
environment is likely to present challenges not seen in training sets or
accounted for in engineered models. Worse still, adversarial environments are
subject to change by opponents. A program at the Defense Advanced Research
Project Agency (DARPA) seeks to develop the science necessary to develop and
evaluate agents that are robust to novelty. This capability will be required,
before AI has the role envisioned within mission critical environments. As part
of the Science of AI and Learning for Open-world Novelty (SAIL-ON), we are
mapping possible military domain novelty types to a domain-independent ontology
developed as part of a theory of novelty. Characterizing the possible space of
novelty mathematically and ontologically will allow us to experiment with agent
designs that are coming from the DARPA SAIL-ON program in relevant military
environments. Utilizing the same techniques as being used in laboratory

Neural Laplace Control for Continuous-time Delayed Systems,"Many real-world offline reinforcement learning (RL) problems involve
continuous-time environments with delays. Such environments are characterized
by two distinctive features: firstly, the state x(t) is observed at irregular
time intervals, and secondly, the current action a(t) only affects the future
state x(t + g) with an unknown delay g > 0. A prime example of such an
environment is satellite control where the communication link between earth and
a satellite causes irregular observations and delays. Existing offline RL
algorithms have achieved success in environments with irregularly observed
states in time or known delays. However, environments involving both irregular
observations in time and unknown delays remains an open and challenging
problem. To this end, we propose Neural Laplace Control, a continuous-time
model-based offline RL method that combines a Neural Laplace dynamics model
with a model predictive control (MPC) planner--and is able to learn from an
offline dataset sampled with irregular time intervals from an environment that
has a inherent unknown constant delay. We show experimentally on
continuous-time delayed environments it is able to achieve near expert policy
performance.",2023-02-24,2023,2023-02,environment
Towards Measuring Ethicality of an Intelligent Assistive System,"Artificial intelligence (AI) based assistive systems, so called intelligent

IAT helps people in improving their quality of life by providing intelligent

self-driving cars, robot assistants and smart-health management solutions.
However, the presence of such autonomous entities poses ethical challenges
concerning the stakeholders involved in using these systems. There is a lack of
research when it comes to analysing how such IAT adheres to provided ethical
regulations due to ethical, logistic and cost issues associated with such an
analysis. In the light of the above-mentioned problem statement and issues, we
present a method to measure the ethicality of an assistive system. To perform
this task, we utilised our simulation tool that focuses on modelling navigation
and assistance of Persons with Dementia (PwD) in indoor environments. By

"Hallucinated Adversarial Control for Conservative Offline Policy
  Evaluation","We study the problem of conservative off-policy evaluation (COPE) where given
an offline dataset of environment interactions, collected by other agents, we
seek to obtain a (tight) lower bound on a policy's performance. This is crucial
when deciding whether a given policy satisfies certain minimal
performance/safety criteria before it can be deployed in the real world. To
this end, we introduce HAMBO, which builds on an uncertainty-aware learned
model of the transition dynamics. To form a conservative estimate of the
policy's performance, HAMBO hallucinates worst-case trajectories that the
policy may take, within the margin of the models' epistemic confidence regions.
We prove that the resulting COPE estimates are valid lower bounds, and, under
regularity conditions, show their convergence to the true expected return.
Finally, we discuss scalable variants of our approach based on Bayesian Neural
Networks and empirically demonstrate that they yield reliable and tight lower
bounds in various continuous control environments.",2023-03-02,2023,2023-03,environment
CoRL: Environment Creation and Management Focused on System Integration,"Existing reinforcement learning environment libraries use monolithic

"Improved Sample Complexity Bounds for Distributionally Robust
  Reinforcement Learning","We consider the problem of learning a control policy that is robust against
the parameter mismatches between the training environment and testing
environment. We formulate this as a distributionally robust reinforcement
learning (DR-RL) problem where the objective is to learn the policy which
maximizes the value function against the worst possible stochastic model of the
environment in an uncertainty set. We focus on the tabular episodic learning
setting where the algorithm has access to a generative model of the nominal
(training) environment around which the uncertainty set is defined. We propose
the Robust Phased Value Learning (RPVL) algorithm to solve this problem for the
uncertainty sets specified by four different divergences: total variation,
chi-square, Kullback-Leibler, and Wasserstein. We show that our algorithm
achieves $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(|\mathcal{S}||\mathcal{A}| H^{5})$ sample
complexity, which is uniformly better than the existing results by a factor of
$|\mathcal{S}|$, where $|\mathcal{S}|$ is number of states, $|\mathcal{A}|$ is

Q-learning algorithms, interact with a single agent. Our findings reveal that
the strategic behavior of AI principals (cooperation vs. competition) hinges
crucially on the alignment of their profits. Notably, greater profit alignment
fosters collusive strategies, yielding higher principal profits at the expense
of agent incentives. This emergent behavior persists across varying degrees of

"Embedding Contextual Information through Reward Shaping in Multi-Agent
  Learning: A Case Study from Google Football","Artificial Intelligence has been used to help human complete difficult tasks
in complicated environments by providing optimized strategies for

MARL is prone to the credit assignment problem. In environments with sparse

Natural Selection Favors AIs over Humans,"For billions of years, evolution has been the driving force behind the
development of life, including humans. Evolution endowed humans with high
intelligence, which allowed us to become one of the most successful species on
the planet. Today, humans aim to create artificial intelligence systems that
surpass even our own intelligence. As artificial intelligences (AIs) evolve and
eventually surpass us in all domains, how might evolution shape our relations
with AIs? By analyzing the environment that is shaping the evolution of AIs, we
argue that the most successful AI agents will likely have undesirable traits.
Competitive pressures among corporations and militaries will give rise to AI
agents that automate human roles, deceive others, and gain power. If such
agents have intelligence that exceeds that of humans, this could lead to
humanity losing control of its future. More abstractly, we argue that natural
selection operates on systems that compete and vary, and that selfish species
typically have an advantage over species that are altruistic to other species.
This Darwinian logic could also apply to artificial agents, as agents may
eventually be better able to persist into the future if they behave selfishly
and pursue their own interests with little regard for humans, which could pose
catastrophic risks. To counteract these risks and evolutionary forces, we
consider interventions such as carefully designing AI agents' intrinsic
motivations, introducing constraints on their actions, and institutions that
encourage cooperation. These steps, or others that resolve the problems we
pose, will be necessary in order to ensure the development of artificial
intelligence is a positive one.",2023-03-28,2023,2023-03,environment
Ontology in Hybrid Intelligence: a concise literature review,"In a context of constant evolution and proliferation of AI technology,Hybrid

"Loss- and Reward-Weighting for Efficient Distributed Reinforcement
  Learning","This paper introduces two learning schemes for distributed agents in
Reinforcement Learning (RL) environments, namely Reward-Weighted (R-Weighted)
and Loss-Weighted (L-Weighted) gradient merger. The R/L weighted methods
replace standard practices for training multiple agents, such as summing or
averaging the gradients. The core of our methods is to scale the gradient of
each actor based on how high the reward (for R-Weighted) or the loss (for
L-Weighted) is compared to the other actors. During training, each agent
operates in differently initialized versions of the same environment, which
gives different gradients from different actors. In essence, the R-Weights and
L-Weights of each agent inform the other agents of its potential, which again
reports which environment should be prioritized for learning. This approach of
distributed learning is possible because environments that yield higher
rewards, or low losses, have more critical information than environments that
yield lower rewards or higher losses. We empirically demonstrate that the
R-Weighted methods work superior to the state-of-the-art in multiple RL
environments.",2023-04-25,2023,2023-04,environment

Simple Noisy Environment Augmentation for Reinforcement Learning,"Data augmentation is a widely used technique for improving model performance
in machine learning, particularly in computer vision and natural language
processing. Recently, there has been increasing interest in applying
augmentation techniques to reinforcement learning (RL) problems, with a focus
on image-based augmentation. In this paper, we explore a set of generic
wrappers designed to augment RL environments with noise and encourage agent
exploration and improve training data diversity which are applicable to a broad
spectrum of RL algorithms and environments. Specifically, we concentrate on
augmentations concerning states, rewards, and transition dynamics and introduce
two novel augmentation techniques. In addition, we introduce a noise rate
hyperparameter for control over the frequency of noise injection. We present
experimental results on the impact of these wrappers on return using three
popular RL algorithms, Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3), and
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), across five MuJoCo environments. To support
the choice of augmentation technique in practice, we also present analysis that
explores the performance these techniques across environments. Lastly, we
publish the wrappers in our noisyenv repository for use with gym environments.",2023-05-04,2023,2023-05,environment
"A Framework for Characterizing Novel Environment Transformations in
  General Environments","To be robust to surprising developments, an intelligent agent must be able to
respond to many different types of unexpected change in the world. To date,
there are no general frameworks for defining and characterizing the types of
environment changes that are possible. We introduce a formal and theoretical
framework for defining and categorizing environment transformations, changes to
the world an agent inhabits. We introduce two types of environment
transformation: R-transformations which modify environment dynamics and
T-transformations which modify the generation process that produces scenarios.
We present a new language for describing domains, scenario generators, and
transformations, called the Transformation and Simulator Abstraction Language
(T-SAL), and a logical formalism that rigorously defines these concepts. Then,
we offer the first formal and computational set of tests for eight categories
of environment transformations. This domain-independent framework paves the way
for describing unambiguous classes of novelty, constrained and
domain-independent random generation of environment transformations,
replication of environment transformation studies, and fair evaluation of agent
robustness.",2023-05-07,2023,2023-05,environment

  Automata","Energy efficiency is a crucial requirement for enabling powerful artificial
intelligence applications at the microedge. Hardware acceleration with frugal
architectural allocation is an effective method for reducing energy. Many
emerging applications also require the systems design to incorporate
interpretable decision models to establish responsibility and transparency. The

energy efficiency. is challenging.
  Recently a new machine learning algorithm, called the Tsetlin machine, has

finite-state automata and benefits from natural logic underpinning rather than
arithmetic. In this paper, we investigate methods of energy-frugal artificial
intelligence hardware design by suitably tuning the hyperparameters, while
maintaining high learning efficacy. To demonstrate interpretability, we use
reachability and game-theoretic analysis in two simulation environments: a
SystemC model to study the bounded state transitions in the presence of
hardware faults and Nash equilibrium between states to analyze the learning
convergence. Our analyses provides the first insights into conflicting design
tradeoffs involved in energy-efficient and interpretable decision models for
this new artificial intelligence hardware architecture. We show that frugal

Vector Autoregressive Evolution for Dynamic Multi-Objective Optimisation,"Dynamic multi-objective optimisation (DMO) handles optimisation problems with
multiple (often conflicting) objectives in varying environments. Such problems
pose various challenges to evolutionary algorithms, which have popularly been
used to solve complex optimisation problems, due to their dynamic nature and
resource restrictions in changing environments. This paper proposes vector
autoregressive evolution (VARE) consisting of vector autoregression (VAR) and
environment-aware hypermutation to address environmental changes in DMO. VARE
builds a VAR model that considers mutual relationship between decision
variables to effectively predict the moving solutions in dynamic environments.
Additionally, VARE introduces EAH to address the blindness of existing
hypermutation strategies in increasing population diversity in dynamic
scenarios where predictive approaches are unsuitable. A seamless integration of
VAR and EAH in an environment-adaptive manner makes VARE effective to handle a
wide range of dynamic environments and competitive with several popular DMO
algorithms, as demonstrated in extensive experimental studies. Specially, the
proposed algorithm is computationally 50 times faster than two widely-used

Learning Safety Constraints from Demonstrations with Unknown Rewards,"We propose Convex Constraint Learning for Reinforcement Learning (CoCoRL), a
novel approach for inferring shared constraints in a Constrained Markov
Decision Process (CMDP) from a set of safe demonstrations with possibly
different reward functions. While previous work is limited to demonstrations
with known rewards or fully known environment dynamics, CoCoRL can learn
constraints from demonstrations with different unknown rewards without
knowledge of the environment dynamics. CoCoRL constructs a convex safe set
based on demonstrations, which provably guarantees safety even for potentially
sub-optimal (but safe) demonstrations. For near-optimal demonstrations, CoCoRL
converges to the true safe set with no policy regret. We evaluate CoCoRL in
gridworld environments and a driving simulation with multiple constraints.
CoCoRL learns constraints that lead to safe driving behavior. Importantly, we
can safely transfer the learned constraints to different tasks and
environments. In contrast, alternative methods based on Inverse Reinforcement
Learning (IRL) often exhibit poor performance and learn unsafe policies.",2023-05-25,2023,2023-05,environment
"Agents Explore the Environment Beyond Good Actions to Improve Their
  Model for Better Decisions","Improving the decision-making capabilities of agents is a key challenge on
the road to artificial intelligence. To improve the planning skills needed to
make good decisions, MuZero's agent combines prediction by a network model and
planning by a tree search using the predictions. MuZero's learning process can
fail when predictions are poor but planning requires them. We use this as an
impetus to get the agent to explore parts of the decision tree in the
environment that it otherwise would not explore. The agent achieves this, first
by normal planning to come up with an improved policy. Second, it randomly
deviates from this policy at the beginning of each training episode. And third,
it switches back to the improved policy at a random time step to experience the
rewards from the environment associated with the improved policy, which is the
basis for learning the correct value expectation. The simple board game
Tic-Tac-Toe is used to illustrate how this approach can improve the agent's
decision-making ability. The source code, written entirely in Java, is

Human in the Loop Novelty Generation,"Developing artificial intelligence approaches to overcome novel, unexpected
circumstances is a difficult, unsolved problem. One challenge to advancing the
state of the art in novelty accommodation is the availability of testing
frameworks for evaluating performance against novel situations. Recent novelty
generation approaches in domains such as Science Birds and Monopoly leverage
human domain expertise during the search to discover new novelties. Such
approaches introduce human guidance before novelty generation occurs and yield
novelties that can be directly loaded into a simulated environment. We
introduce a new approach to novelty generation that uses abstract models of
environments (including simulation domains) that do not require
domain-dependent human guidance to generate novelties. A key result is a
larger, often infinite space of novelties capable of being generated, with the
trade-off being a requirement to involve human guidance to select and filter
novelties post generation. We describe our Human-in-the-Loop novelty generation
process using our open-source novelty generation library to test baseline
agents in two domains: Monopoly and VizDoom. Our results shows the
Human-in-the-Loop method enables users to develop, implement, test, and revise
novelties within 4 hours for both Monopoly and VizDoom domains.",2023-06-07,2023,2023-06,environment

iPDP: On Partial Dependence Plots in Dynamic Modeling Scenarios,"Post-hoc explanation techniques such as the well-established partial
dependence plot (PDP), which investigates feature dependencies, are used in
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to understand black-box machine

constantly adapt over time and react to changes in the underlying distribution,
XAI, so far, has primarily considered static learning environments, where
models are trained in a batch mode and remain unchanged. We thus propose a
novel model-agnostic XAI framework called incremental PDP (iPDP) that extends
on the PDP to extract time-dependent feature effects in non-stationary learning
environments. We formally analyze iPDP and show that it approximates a
time-dependent variant of the PDP that properly reacts to real and virtual
concept drift. The time-sensitivity of iPDP is controlled by a single smoothing
parameter, which directly corresponds to the variance and the approximation
error of iPDP in a static learning environment. We illustrate the efficacy of
iPDP by showcasing an example application for drift detection and conducting
multiple experiments on real-world and synthetic data sets and streams.",2023-06-13,2023,2023-06,environment

BISCUIT: Causal Representation Learning from Binary Interactions,"Identifying the causal variables of an environment and how to intervene on

an agent can commonly interact with the environment and may implicitly perturb

identified for many common setups, e.g., additive Gaussian noise models, if the
agent's interactions with a causal variable can be described by an unknown
binary variable. This happens when each causal variable has two different
mechanisms, e.g., an observational and an interventional one. Using this

"Explainable Artificial Intelligence driven mask design for
  self-supervised seismic denoising","The presence of coherent noise in seismic data leads to errors and
uncertainties, and as such it is paramount to suppress noise as early and
efficiently as possible. Self-supervised denoising circumvents the common
requirement of deep learning procedures of having noisy-clean training pairs.
However, self-supervised coherent noise suppression methods require extensive
knowledge of the noise statistics. We propose the use of explainable artificial
intelligence approaches to see inside the black box that is the denoising
network and use the gained knowledge to replace the need for any prior
knowledge of the noise itself. This is achieved in practice by leveraging
bias-free networks and the direct linear link between input and output provided
by the associated Jacobian matrix; we show that a simple averaging of the
Jacobian contributions over a number of randomly selected input pixels,
provides an indication of the most effective mask to suppress noise present in
the data. The proposed method therefore becomes a fully automated denoising
procedure requiring no clean training labels or prior knowledge. Realistic
synthetic examples with noise signals of varying complexities, ranging from
simple time-correlated noise to complex pseudo rig noise propagating at the
velocity of the ocean, are used to validate the proposed approach. Its
automated nature is highlighted further by an application to two field
datasets. Without any substantial pre-processing or any knowledge of the

dynamics in the environment. This is because they adopt optimization procedures
that assume stationarity to evolve a coverage set of policies that can solve
the problem. This paper introduces a developmental optimization approach that
can evolve the policy coverage set while exploring the preference space over
the defined objectives in an online manner. We propose a novel multi-objective
reinforcement learning algorithm that can robustly evolve a convex coverage set
of policies in an online manner in non-stationary environments. We compare the
proposed algorithm with two state-of-the-art multi-objective reinforcement
learning algorithms in stationary and non-stationary environments. Results
showed that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the existing
algorithms in non-stationary environments while achieving comparable results in
stationary environments.",2023-08-18,2023,2023-08,environment
Model-based Offline Policy Optimization with Adversarial Network,"Model-based offline reinforcement learning (RL), which builds a supervised
transition model with logging dataset to avoid costly interactions with the
online environment, has been a promising approach for offline policy
optimization. As the discrepancy between the logging data and online
environment may result in a distributional shift problem, many prior works have
studied how to build robust transition models conservatively and estimate the
model uncertainty accurately. However, the over-conservatism can limit the
exploration of the agent, and the uncertainty estimates may be unreliable. In
this work, we propose a novel Model-based Offline policy optimization framework
with Adversarial Network (MOAN). The key idea is to use adversarial learning to
build a transition model with better generalization, where an adversary is
introduced to distinguish between in-distribution and out-of-distribution
samples. Moreover, the adversary can naturally provide a quantification of the
model's uncertainty with theoretical guarantees. Extensive experiments showed
that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines on widely
studied offline RL benchmarks. It can also generate diverse in-distribution
samples, and quantify the uncertainty more accurately.",2023-09-05,2023,2023-09,environment

consisting of numerous worlds, each of which will offer a different set of
services. To deal with such a dynamic and complex scenario, considering the
stringent quality of service requirements aimed at the 6th generation of
communication systems (6G), one potential approach is to adopt self-sustaining
strategies, which can be realized by employing Adaptive Artificial Intelligence
(Adaptive AI) where models are continually re-trained with new data and

Context is Environment,"Two lines of work are taking the central stage in AI research. On the one
hand, the community is making increasing efforts to build models that discard
spurious correlations and generalize better in novel test environments.
Unfortunately, the bitter lesson so far is that no proposal convincingly
outperforms a simple empirical risk minimization baseline. On the other hand,
large language models (LLMs) have erupted as algorithms able to learn
in-context, generalizing on-the-fly to eclectic contextual circumstances that
users enforce by means of prompting. In this paper, we argue that context is
environment, and posit that in-context learning holds the key to better domain
generalization. Via extensive theory and experiments, we show that paying
attention to context$\unicode{x2013}\unicode{x2013}$unlabeled examples as they
arrive$\unicode{x2013}\unicode{x2013}$allows our proposed In-Context Risk
Minimization (ICRM) algorithm to zoom-in on the test environment risk
minimizer, leading to significant out-of-distribution performance improvements.
From all of this, two messages are worth taking home. Researchers in domain
generalization should consider environment as context, and harness the adaptive

"Curriculum Reinforcement Learning via Morphology-Environment
  Co-Evolution","Throughout long history, natural species have learned to survive by evolving
their physical structures adaptive to the environment changes. In contrast,
current reinforcement learning (RL) studies mainly focus on training an agent
with a fixed morphology (e.g., skeletal structure and joint attributes) in a
fixed environment, which can hardly generalize to changing environments or new
tasks. In this paper, we optimize an RL agent and its morphology through
``morphology-environment co-evolution (MECE)'', in which the morphology keeps
being updated to adapt to the changing environment, while the environment is
modified progressively to bring new challenges and stimulate the improvement of
the morphology. This leads to a curriculum to train generalizable RL, whose
morphology and policy are optimized for different environments. Instead of
hand-crafting the curriculum, we train two policies to automatically change the
morphology and the environment. To this end, (1) we develop two novel and
effective rewards for the two policies, which are solely based on the learning
dynamics of the RL agent; (2) we design a scheduler to automatically determine
when to change the environment and the morphology. In experiments on two
classes of tasks, the morphology and RL policies trained via MECE exhibit
significantly better generalization performance in unseen test environments
than SOTA morphology optimization methods. Our ablation studies on the two MECE
policies further show that the co-evolution between the morphology and

challenging task that aims at bridging the gap between low-level sensor

have to be handled by the robot. To overcome these issues, we propose a
graph-based representation that addresses this gap by providing a semantic
representation of robot environments from multiple sources. In fact, to acquire
information from the environment, the framework combines classical computer
vision tools with modern computer vision cloud services, ensuring computational
feasibility on onboard hardware. By incorporating an ontology hierarchy with
over 800 object classes, the framework achieves cross-domain adaptability,
eliminating the need for environment-specific tools. The proposed approach
allows us to handle also small objects and integrate them into the semantic

that identical actions can consistently achieve the same goal. In this paper,
we introduce an UNcertainty-awaRE deciSion Transformer (UNREST) for planning in
stochastic driving environments without introducing additional transition or
complex generative models. Specifically, UNREST estimates uncertainties by
conditional mutual information between transitions and returns. Discovering
'uncertainty accumulation' and 'temporal locality' properties of driving
environments, we replace the global returns in decision transformers with
truncated returns less affected by environments to learn from actual outcomes
of actions rather than environment transitions. We also dynamically evaluate
uncertainty at inference for cautious planning. Extensive experiments
demonstrate UNREST's superior performance in various driving scenarios and the
power of our uncertainty estimation strategy.",2023-09-28,2023,2023-09,environment
Discovering environments with XRM,"Environment annotations are essential for the success of many
out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization methods. Unfortunately, these are

methods introduce hyper-parameters and early-stopping criteria, which require a
validation set with human-annotated environments, the very information subject
to discovery. In this paper, we propose Cross-Risk-Minimization (XRM) to
address this issue. XRM trains twin networks, each learning from one random
half of the training data, while imitating confident held-out mistakes made by
its sibling. XRM provides a recipe for hyper-parameter tuning, does not require
early-stopping, and can discover environments for all training and validation

introduce a hierarchical MDP framework for environment design under resource

suitable training environments for a lower-level student agent. The RL teacher
can leverage previously discovered environment structures and generate
environments at the frontier of the student's capabilities by observing the
student policy's representation. Moreover, to reduce the time-consuming
collection of experiences for the upper-level teacher, we utilize recent
advances in generative modeling to synthesize a trajectory dataset to train the

Measuring Acoustics with Collaborative Multiple Agents,"As humans, we hear sound every second of our life. The sound we hear is often

measured by setting up a loudspeaker and microphone in the environment for all
source/receiver locations, which is time-consuming and inefficient. We propose
to let two robots measure the environment's acoustics by actively moving and
emitting/receiving sweep signals. We also devise a collaborative multi-agent
policy where these two robots are trained to explore the environment's
acoustics while being rewarded for wide exploration and accurate prediction. We

"Large Language Model Prediction Capabilities: Evidence from a Real-World
  Forecasting Tournament","Accurately predicting the future would be an important milestone in the
capabilities of artificial intelligence. However, research on the ability of
large language models to provide probabilistic predictions about future events
remains nascent. To empirically test this ability, we enrolled OpenAI's
state-of-the-art large language model, GPT-4, in a three-month forecasting
tournament hosted on the Metaculus platform. The tournament, running from July
to October 2023, attracted 843 participants and covered diverse topics
including Big Tech, U.S. politics, viral outbreaks, and the Ukraine conflict.
Focusing on binary forecasts, we show that GPT-4's probabilistic forecasts are
significantly less accurate than the median human-crowd forecasts. We find that
GPT-4's forecasts did not significantly differ from the no-information
forecasting strategy of assigning a 50% probability to every question. We
explore a potential explanation, that GPT-4 might be predisposed to predict
probabilities close to the midpoint of the scale, but our data do not support
this hypothesis. Overall, we find that GPT-4 significantly underperforms in
real-world predictive tasks compared to median human-crowd forecasts. A
potential explanation for this underperformance is that in real-world
forecasting tournaments, the true answers are genuinely unknown at the time of
prediction; unlike in other benchmark tasks like professional exams or time
series forecasting, where strong performance may at least partly be due to the
answers being memorized from the training data. This makes real-world

Arbitrarily Scalable Environment Generators via Neural Cellular Automata,"We study the problem of generating arbitrarily large environments to improve

sizes. The challenge arises from the exponential increase in the search space
as the environment size increases. Additionally, the previous methods have only
been tested with up to 350 robots in simulations, while practical warehouses
could host thousands of robots. In this paper, instead of optimizing

"Environment-Aware Dynamic Graph Learning for Out-of-Distribution
  Generalization","Dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) are increasingly pervasive in
exploiting spatio-temporal patterns on dynamic graphs. However, existing works
fail to generalize under distribution shifts, which are common in real-world
scenarios. As the generation of dynamic graphs is heavily influenced by latent
environments, investigating their impacts on the out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization is critical. However, it remains unexplored with the following
two major challenges: (1) How to properly model and infer the complex
environments on dynamic graphs with distribution shifts? (2) How to discover
invariant patterns given inferred spatio-temporal environments? To solve these
challenges, we propose a novel Environment-Aware dynamic Graph LEarning (EAGLE)
framework for OOD generalization by modeling complex coupled environments and
exploiting spatio-temporal invariant patterns. Specifically, we first design
the environment-aware EA-DGNN to model environments by multi-channel
environments disentangling. Then, we propose an environment instantiation
mechanism for environment diversification with inferred distributions. Finally,
we discriminate spatio-temporal invariant patterns for out-of-distribution
prediction by the invariant pattern recognition mechanism and perform
fine-grained causal interventions node-wisely with a mixture of instantiated
environment samples. Experiments on real-world and synthetic dynamic graph
datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method against state-of-the-art
baselines under distribution shifts. To the best of our knowledge, we are the
first to study OOD generalization on dynamic graphs from the environment
learning perspective.",2023-11-18,2023,2023-11,environment
"Synthetic Data Generation for Bridging Sim2Real Gap in a Production
  Environment","Synthetic data is being used lately for training deep neural networks in
computer vision applications such as object detection, object segmentation and
6D object pose estimation. Domain randomization hereby plays an important role
in reducing the simulation to reality gap. However, this generalization might
not be effective in specialized domains like a production environment involving
complex assemblies. Either the individual parts, trained with synthetic images,
are integrated in much larger assemblies making them indistinguishable from
their counterparts and result in false positives or are partially occluded just
enough to give rise to false negatives. Domain knowledge is vital in these
cases and if conceived effectively while generating synthetic data, can show a
considerable improvement in bridging the simulation to reality gap. This paper
focuses on synthetic data generation procedures for parts and assemblies used
in a production environment. The basic procedures for synthetic data generation
and their various combinations are evaluated and compared on images captured in
a production environment, where results show up to 15% improvement using

"Learning Unknown Intervention Targets in Structural Causal Models from
  Heterogeneous Data","We study the problem of identifying the unknown intervention targets in
structural causal models where we have access to heterogeneous data collected
from multiple environments. The unknown intervention targets are the set of
endogenous variables whose corresponding exogenous noises change across the
environments. We propose a two-phase approach which in the first phase recovers
the exogenous noises corresponding to unknown intervention targets whose
distributions have changed across environments. In the second phase, the
recovered noises are matched with the corresponding endogenous variables. For
the recovery phase, we provide sufficient conditions for learning these
exogenous noises up to some component-wise invertible transformation. For the
matching phase, under the causal sufficiency assumption, we show that the
proposed method uniquely identifies the intervention targets. In the presence
of latent confounders, the intervention targets among the observed variables
cannot be determined uniquely. We provide a candidate intervention target set
which is a superset of the true intervention targets. Our approach improves
upon the state of the art as the returned candidate set is always a subset of
the target set returned by previous work. Moreover, we do not require
restrictive assumptions such as linearity of the causal model or performing
invariance tests to learn whether a distribution is changing across
environments which could be highly sample inefficient. Our experimental results

"A Conservative Approach for Few-Shot Transfer in Off-Dynamics

Vision-Language Navigation with Embodied Intelligence: A Survey,"As a long-term vision in the field of artificial intelligence, the core goal
of embodied intelligence is to improve the perception, understanding, and
interaction capabilities of agents and the environment. Vision-language
navigation (VLN), as a critical research path to achieve embodied intelligence,

field faces technical challenges but shows potential for application such as
human-computer interaction. However, due to the complex process involved from
language understanding to action execution, VLN faces the problem of aligning
visual information and language instructions, improving generalization ability,

"Artificial Intelligence for Complex Network: Potential, Methodology and

environment to human societies. The essence of these networks is in their
ability to transition and evolve from microscopic disorder-where network

certain collective behaviors. Over the past two decades, complex network
science has significantly enhanced our understanding of the statistical
mechanics, structures, and dynamics underlying real-world networks. Despite

Brain-inspired and Self-based Artificial Intelligence,"The question ""Can machines think?"" and the Turing Test to assess whether
machines could achieve human-level intelligence is one of the roots of AI. With
the philosophical argument ""I think, therefore I am"", this paper challenge the
idea of a ""thinking machine"" supported by current AIs since there is no sense
of self in them. Current artificial intelligence is only seemingly intelligent
information processing and does not truly understand or be subjectively aware
of oneself and perceive the world with the self as human intelligence does. In
this paper, we introduce a Brain-inspired and Self-based Artificial
Intelligence (BriSe AI) paradigm. This BriSe AI paradigm is dedicated to
coordinating various cognitive functions and learning strategies in a
self-organized manner to build human-level AI models and robotic applications.
Specifically, BriSe AI emphasizes the crucial role of the Self in shaping the
future AI, rooted with a practical hierarchical Self framework, including
Perception and Learning, Bodily Self, Autonomous Self, Social Self, and
Conceptual Self. The hierarchical framework of the Self highlights self-based
environment perception, self-bodily modeling, autonomous interaction with the
environment, social interaction and collaboration with others, and even more
abstract understanding of the Self. Furthermore, the positive mutual promotion
and support among multiple levels of Self, as well as between Self and
learning, enhance the BriSe AI's conscious understanding of information and
flexible adaptation to complex environments, serving as a driving force
propelling BriSe AI towards real Artificial General Intelligence.",2024-02-29,2024,2024-02,environment
"Mathematics of multi-agent learning systems at the interface of game
  theory and artificial intelligence","Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are two
fields that, at first glance, might seem distinct, but they have notable
connections and intersections. The former focuses on the evolution of behaviors
(or strategies) in a population, where individuals interact with others and
update their strategies based on imitation (or social learning). The more
successful a strategy is, the more prevalent it becomes over time. The latter,
meanwhile, is centered on machine learning algorithms and (deep) neural
networks. It is often from a single-agent perspective but increasingly involves
multi-agent environments, in which intelligent agents adjust their strategies
based on feedback and experience, somewhat akin to the evolutionary process yet
distinct in their self-learning capacities. In light of the key components
necessary to address real-world problems, including (i) learning and
adaptation, (ii) cooperation and competition, (iii) robustness and stability,
and altogether (iv) population dynamics of individual agents whose strategies
evolve, the cross-fertilization of ideas between both fields will contribute to
the advancement of mathematics of multi-agent learning systems, in particular,

SymboSLAM: Semantic Map Generation in a Multi-Agent System,"Sub-symbolic artificial intelligence methods dominate the fields of
environment-type classification and Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping.
However, a significant area overlooked within these fields is solution
transparency for the human-machine interaction space, as the sub-symbolic

the solutions generated. This paper proposes a novel approach to
environment-type classification through Symbolic Simultaneous Localisation and
Mapping, SymboSLAM, to bridge the explainability gap. Our method for
environment-type classification observes ontological reasoning used to
synthesise the context of an environment through the features found within. We
achieve explainability within the model by presenting operators with

"Collaborative AI Teaming in Unknown Environments via Active Goal
  Deduction","With the advancements of artificial intelligence (AI), we're seeing more
scenarios that require AI to work closely with other agents, whose goals and

latent objectives/rewards. In response to this challenge, we propose teaming
with unknown agents framework, which leverages kernel density Bayesian inverse
learning method for active goal deduction and utilizes pre-trained,
goal-conditioned policies to enable zero-shot policy adaptation. We prove that
unbiased reward estimates in our framework are sufficient for optimal teaming
with unknown agents. We further evaluate the framework of redesigned
multi-agent particle and StarCraft II micromanagement environments with diverse
unknown agents of different behaviors/rewards. Empirical results demonstrate
that our framework significantly advances the teaming performance of AI and

This study explores the performance of RL agents in both two-dimensional (2D)

Dynamic Quality-Diversity Search,"Evolutionary search via the quality-diversity (QD) paradigm can discover
highly performing solutions in different behavioural niches, showing
considerable potential in complex real-world scenarios such as evolutionary
robotics. Yet most QD methods only tackle static tasks that are fixed over

where the fitness of an individual changes slightly at every evaluation,
dynamic environments simulate tasks where external factors at unknown and
irregular intervals alter the performance of the individual with a severity
that is unknown a priori. Literature on optimisation in dynamic environments is
extensive, yet such environments have not been explored in the context of QD
search. This paper introduces a novel and generalisable Dynamic QD methodology
that aims to keep the archive of past solutions updated in the case of
environment changes. Secondly, we present a novel characterisation of dynamic
environments that can be easily applied to well-known benchmarks, with minor

Sustainability of Data Center Digital Twins with Reinforcement Learning,"The rapid growth of machine learning (ML) has led to an increased demand for

"Explaining AI Decisions: Towards Achieving Human-Centered Explainability

their living and working environments while minimizing energy consumption.
However, the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled decision-making
models in smart home systems faces challenges due to the complexity and
black-box nature of these systems, leading to concerns about explainability,
trust, transparency, accountability, and fairness. The emerging field of
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) addresses these issues by providing
explanations for the models' decisions and actions. While state-of-the-art XAI
methods are beneficial for AI developers and practitioners, they may not be

"Leveraging AI to Generate Audio for User-generated Content in Video

Isopignistic Canonical Decomposition via Belief Evolution Network,"Developing a general information processing model in uncertain environments
is fundamental for the advancement of explainable artificial intelligence.
Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence is a well-known and effective reasoning
method for representing epistemic uncertainty, which is closely related to
subjective probability theory and possibility theory. Although they can be
transformed to each other under some particular belief structures, there
remains a lack of a clear and interpretable transformation process, as well as
a unified approach for information processing. In this paper, we aim to address
these issues from the perspectives of isopignistic belief functions and the
hyper-cautious transferable belief model. Firstly, we propose an isopignistic
transformation based on the belief evolution network. This transformation
allows for the adjustment of the information granule while retaining the
potential decision outcome. The isopignistic transformation is integrated with
a hyper-cautious transferable belief model to establish a new canonical
decomposition. This decomposition offers a reverse path between the possibility
distribution and its isopignistic mass functions. The result of the canonical
decomposition, called isopignistic function, is an identical information
content distribution to reflect the propensity and relative commitment degree
of the BPA. Furthermore, this paper introduces a method to reconstruct the
basic belief assignment by adjusting the isopignistic function. It explores the
advantages of this approach in modeling and handling uncertainty within the
hyper-cautious transferable belief model. More general, this paper establishes

"Transfer Learning for CSI-based Positioning with Multi-environment
  Meta-learning","Utilizing deep learning (DL) techniques for radio-based positioning of user
equipment (UE) through channel state information (CSI) fingerprints has
demonstrated significant potential. DL models can extract complex
characteristics from the CSI fingerprints of a particular environment and
accurately predict the position of a UE. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of the
DL model trained on CSI fingerprints is highly dependent on the particular
training environment, limiting the trained model's applicability across
different environments. This paper proposes a novel DL model structure
consisting of two parts, where the first part aims at identifying features that
are independent from any specific environment, while the second part combines
those features in an environment specific way with the goal of positioning. To
train such a two-part model, we propose the multi-environment meta-learning
(MEML) approach for the first part to facilitate training across various
environments, while the second part of the model is trained solely on data from
a specific environment. Our findings indicate that employing the MEML approach
for initializing the weights of the DL model for a new unseen environment
significantly boosts the accuracy of UE positioning in the new target
environment as well the reliability of its uncertainty estimation. This method
outperforms traditional transfer learning methods, whether direct transfer
learning (DTL) between environments or completely training from scratch with
data from a new environment. The proposed approach is verified with real
measurements for both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS (NLOS) environments.",2024-05-20,2024,2024-05,environment

"Meta-Learners for Partially-Identified Treatment Effects Across Multiple
  Environments","Estimating the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) from observational
data is relevant for many applications such as personalized medicine. Here, we
focus on the widespread setting where the observational data come from multiple
environments, such as different hospitals, physicians, or countries.
Furthermore, we allow for violations of standard causal assumptions, namely,
overlap within the environments and unconfoundedness. To this end, we move away
from point identification and focus on partial identification. Specifically, we
show that current assumptions from the literature on multiple environments
allow us to interpret the environment as an instrumental variable (IV). This
allows us to adapt bounds from the IV literature for partial identification of
CATE by leveraging treatment assignment mechanisms across environments. Then,
we propose different model-agnostic learners (so-called meta-learners) to
estimate the bounds that can be used in combination with arbitrary machine

Next-generation onboard AI systems need an even higher power since they collect

emerging and unfamiliar studies face limitations, including safety concerns and
iterative efficiency. To address these challenges, this study utilises a
Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) to create GenAI-generated scenarios

we can collect feedback that enables rapid iteration in the early design phase.
The air taxi is particularly representative of these challenges and has been

increasing heterogeneity in vehicle capabilities and density, increased levels
of automation are likely necessary to achieve operational safety and efficiency
goals. This paper focuses on one example where increased automation has been
suggested. Autonomous operations will need contingency management systems that
can monitor evolving risk across a span of interrelated (or interdependent)
hazards and, if necessary, execute appropriate control interventions via
supervised or automated decision making. Accommodating this complex environment

"Efficiently Training Neural Networks for Imperfect Information Games by
  Sampling Information Sets","In imperfect information games, the evaluation of a game state not only
depends on the observable world but also relies on hidden parts of the
environment. As accessing the obstructed information trivialises state
evaluations, one approach to tackle such problems is to estimate the value of
the imperfect state as a combination of all states in the information set,
i.e., all possible states that are consistent with the current imperfect
information. In this work, the goal is to learn a function that maps from the
imperfect game information state to its expected value. However, constructing a
perfect training set, i.e. an enumeration of the whole information set for
numerous imperfect states, is often infeasible. To compute the expected values
for an imperfect information game like \textit{Reconnaissance Blind Chess}, one
would need to evaluate thousands of chess positions just to obtain the training
target for a single state. Still, the expected value of a state can already be
approximated with appropriate accuracy from a much smaller set of evaluations.
Thus, in this paper, we empirically investigate how a budget of perfect
information game evaluations should be distributed among training samples to
maximise the return. Our results show that sampling a small number of states,
in our experiments roughly 3, for a larger number of separate positions is
preferable over repeatedly sampling a smaller quantity of states. Thus, we find
that in our case, the quantity of different samples seems to be more important

safety-critical environment where failures can have high costs. The estimated
risk from the anomaly detection model is utilized to train a risk-averse RL
policy in the target environment; this involves adjusting the reward function
to penalize the agent for visiting anomalous states deemed unsafe by our

"A Safe Exploration Strategy for Model-free Task Adaptation in
  Safety-constrained Grid Environments","Training a model-free reinforcement learning agent requires allowing the
agent to sufficiently explore the environment to search for an optimal policy.
In safety-constrained environments, utilizing unsupervised exploration or a
non-optimal policy may lead the agent to undesirable states, resulting in
outcomes that are potentially costly or hazardous for both the agent and the
environment. In this paper, we introduce a new exploration framework for
navigating the grid environments that enables model-free agents to interact
with the environment while adhering to safety constraints. Our framework
includes a pre-training phase, during which the agent learns to identify
potentially unsafe states based on both observable features and specified
safety constraints in the environment. Subsequently, a binary classification
model is trained to predict those unsafe states in new environments that
exhibit similar dynamics. This trained classifier empowers model-free agents to
determine situations in which employing random exploration or a suboptimal
policy may pose safety risks, in which case our framework prompts the agent to
follow a predefined safe policy to mitigate the potential for hazardous
consequences. We evaluated our framework on three randomly generated grid
environments and demonstrated how model-free agents can safely adapt to new
tasks and learn optimal policies for new environments. Our results indicate
that by defining an appropriate safe policy and utilizing a well-trained model

"The Impact of Environment Configurations on the Stability of AI-Enabled
  Systems","Nowadays, software systems tend to include Artificial Intelligence (AI)
components. Changes in the operational environment have been known to
negatively impact the stability of AI-enabled software systems by causing
unintended changes in behavior. However, how an environment configuration
impacts the behavior of such systems has yet to be explored. Understanding and
quantifying the degree of instability caused by different environment settings
can help practitioners decide the best environment configuration for the most
stable AI systems. To achieve this goal, we performed experiments with eight
different combinations of three key environment variables (operating system,
Python version, and CPU architecture) on $30$ open-source AI-enabled systems
using the Travis CI platform. We determine the existence and the degree of
instability introduced by each configuration using three metrics: the output of
an AI component of the system (model performance), the time required to build
and run the system (processing time), and the cost associated with building and
running the system (expense). Our results indicate that changes in environment
configurations lead to instability across all three metrics; however, it is
observed more frequently with respect to processing time and expense rather
than model performance. For example, between Linux and MacOS, instability is
observed in 23\%, 96.67\%, and 100\% of the studied projects in model
performance, processing time, and expense, respectively. Our findings
underscore the importance of identifying the optimal combination of
configuration settings to mitigate drops in model performance and reduce the
processing time and expense before deploying an AI-enabled system.",2024-08-05,2024,2024-08,environment
Dynamic Fog Computing for Enhanced LLM Execution in Medical Applications,"The ability of large language models (LLMs) to transform, interpret, and
comprehend vast quantities of heterogeneous data presents a significant
opportunity to enhance data-driven care delivery. However, the sensitive nature
of protected health information (PHI) raises valid concerns about data privacy
and trust in remote LLM platforms. In addition, the cost associated with
cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) services continues to impede
widespread adoption. To address these challenges, we propose a shift in the LLM
execution environment from opaque, centralized cloud providers to a
decentralized and dynamic fog computing architecture. By executing open-weight
LLMs in more trusted environments, such as the user's edge device or a fog
layer within a local network, we aim to mitigate the privacy, trust, and
financial challenges associated with cloud-based LLMs. We further present
SpeziLLM, an open-source framework designed to facilitate rapid and seamless
leveraging of different LLM execution layers and lowering barriers to LLM

versatility in various healthcare settings.",2024-08-08,2024,2024-08,environment
Detection and tracking of barchan dunes using Artificial Intelligence,"Barchans are crescent-shape dunes ubiquitous on Earth and other celestial
bodies, which are organized in barchan fields where they interact with each
other. Over the last decades, satellite images have been largely employed to
detect barchans on Earth and on the surface of Mars, with AI (Artificial
Intelligence) becoming an important tool for monitoring those bedforms.
However, automatic detection reported in previous works is limited to isolated
dunes and does not identify successfully groups of interacting barchans. In
this paper, we inquire into the automatic detection and tracking of barchans by
carrying out experiments and exploring the acquired images using AI. After
training a neural network with images from controlled experiments where complex
interactions took place between dunes, we did the same for satellite images
from Earth and Mars. We show, for the first time, that a neural network trained
properly can identify and track barchans interacting with each other in
different environments, using different image types (contrasts, colors, points
of view, resolutions, etc.), with confidence scores (accuracy) above 70%. Our
results represent a step further for automatically monitoring barchans, with
important applications for human activities on Earth, Mars and other celestial
bodies.",2024-08-14,2024,2024-08,environment
A Logic for Policy Based Resource Exchanges in Multiagent Systems,"In multiagent systems autonomous agents interact with each other to achieve
individual and collective goals. Typical interactions concern negotiation and
agreement on resource exchanges. Modeling and formalizing these agreements pose
significant challenges, particularly in capturing the dynamic behaviour of
agents, while ensuring that resources are correctly handled. Here, we propose
exchange environments as a formal setting where agents specify and obey
exchange policies, which are declarative statements about what resources they
offer and what they require in return. Furthermore, we introduce a decidable
extension of the computational fragment of linear logic as a fundamental tool
for representing exchange environments and studying their dynamics in terms of

Can Artificial Intelligence Embody Moral Values?,"The neutrality thesis holds that technology cannot be laden with values. This
long-standing view has faced critiques, but much of the argumentation against
neutrality has focused on traditional, non-smart technologies like bridges and
razors. In contrast, AI is a smart technology increasingly used in high-stakes
domains like healthcare, finance, and policing, where its decisions can cause
moral harm. In this paper, we argue that artificial intelligence, particularly
artificial agents that autonomously make decisions to pursue their goals,
challenge the neutrality thesis. Our central claim is that the computational
models underlying artificial agents can integrate representations of moral
values such as fairness, honesty and avoiding harm. We provide a conceptual
framework discussing the neutrality thesis, values, and AI. Moreover, we
examine two approaches to designing computational models of morality,
artificial conscience and ethical prompting, and present empirical evidence
from text-based game environments that artificial agents with such models
exhibit more ethical behavior compared to agents without these models. The
findings support that AI can embody moral values, which contradicts the claim
that all technologies are necessarily value-neutral.",2024-08-22,2024,2024-08,environment
Identifying the Best Arm in the Presence of Global Environment Shifts,"This paper formulates a new Best-Arm Identification problem in the
non-stationary stochastic bandits setting, where the means of all arms are
shifted in the same way due to a global influence of the environment. The aim
is to identify the unique best arm across environmental change given a fixed
total budget. While this setting can be regarded as a special case of
Adversarial Bandits or Corrupted Bandits, we demonstrate that existing
solutions tailored to those settings do not fully utilise the nature of this
global influence, and thus, do not work well in practice (despite their
theoretical guarantees). To overcome this issue, in this paper we develop a
novel selection policy that is consistent and robust in dealing with global
environmental shifts. We then propose an allocation policy, LinLUCB, which
exploits information about global shifts across all arms in each environment.
Empirical tests depict a significant improvement in our policies against other
existing methods.",2024-08-22,2024,2024-08,environment
"Localized Observation Abstraction Using Piecewise Linear Spatial Decay
  for Reinforcement Learning in Combat Simulations","In the domain of combat simulations, the training and deployment of deep
reinforcement learning (RL) agents still face substantial challenges due to the
dynamic and intricate nature of such environments. Unfortunately, as the
complexity of the scenarios and available information increases, the training
time required to achieve a certain threshold of performance does not just
increase, but often does so exponentially. This relationship underscores the
profound impact of complexity in training RL agents. This paper introduces a
novel approach that addresses this limitation in training artificial
intelligence (AI) agents using RL. Traditional RL methods have been shown to
struggle in these high-dimensional, dynamic environments due to real-world
computational constraints and the known sample inefficiency challenges of RL.
To overcome these limitations, we propose a method of localized observation
abstraction using piecewise linear spatial decay. This technique simplifies the
state space, reducing computational demands while still preserving essential
information, thereby enhancing AI training efficiency in dynamic environments
where spatial relationships are often critical. Our analysis reveals that this
localized observation approach consistently outperforms the more traditional
global observation approach across increasing scenario complexity levels. This
paper advances the research on observation abstractions for RL, illustrating
how localized observation with piecewise linear spatial decay can provide an
effective solution to large state representation challenges in dynamic
environments.",2024-08-23,2024,2024-08,environment
Environment-Centric Active Inference,"To handle unintended changes in the environment by agents, we propose an
environment-centric active inference EC-AIF in which the Markov Blanket of
active inference is defined starting from the environment. In normal active
inference, the Markov Blanket is defined starting from the agent. That is,
first the agent was defined as the entity that performs the ""action"" such as a
robot or a person, then the environment was defined as other people or objects
that are directly affected by the agent's ""action,"" and the boundary between
the agent and the environment was defined as the Markov Blanket. This
agent-centric definition does not allow the agent to respond to unintended
changes in the environment caused by factors outside of the defined
environment. In the proposed EC-AIF, there is no entity corresponding to an
agent. The environment includes all observable things, including people and
things conventionally considered to be the environment, as well as entities
that perform ""actions"" such as robots and people. Accordingly, all states,
including robots and people, are included in inference targets, eliminating
unintended changes in the environment. The EC-AIF was applied to a robot arm
and validated with an object transport task by the robot arm. The results
showed that the robot arm successfully transported objects while responding to
changes in the target position of the object and to changes in the orientation
of another robot arm.",2024-08-23,2024,2024-08,environment

"Benchmarking Deep Reinforcement Learning for Navigation in Denied Sensor
  Environments","Deep Reinforcement learning (DRL) is used to enable autonomous navigation in
unknown environments. Most research assume perfect sensor data, but real-world
environments may contain natural and artificial sensor noise and denial. Here,
we present a benchmark of both well-used and emerging DRL algorithms in a
navigation task with configurable sensor denial effects. In particular, we are
interested in comparing how different DRL methods (e.g. model-free PPO vs.
model-based DreamerV3) are affected by sensor denial. We show that DreamerV3
outperforms other methods in the visual end-to-end navigation task with a
dynamic goal - and other methods are not able to learn this. Furthermore,
DreamerV3 generally outperforms other methods in sensor-denied environments. In
order to improve robustness, we use adversarial training and demonstrate an
improved performance in denied environments, although this generally comes with
a performance cost on the vanilla environments. We anticipate this benchmark of
different DRL methods and the usage of adversarial training to be a starting
point for the development of more elaborate navigation strategies that are
capable of dealing with uncertain and denied sensor readings.",2024-10-18,2024,2024-10,environment

"DyPNIPP: Predicting Environment Dynamics for RL-based Robust Informative
  Path Planning","Informative path planning (IPP) is an important planning paradigm for various
real-world robotic applications such as environment monitoring. IPP involves

variations in environment characteristics. In this paper, we propose DyPNIPP, a
robust RL-based IPP framework, designed to operate effectively across
spatio-temporal environments with varying dynamics. To achieve this, DyPNIPP
incorporates domain randomization to train the agent across diverse

Adversarial Environment Design via Regret-Guided Diffusion Models,"Training agents that are robust to environmental changes remains a
significant challenge in deep reinforcement learning (RL). Unsupervised
environment design (UED) has recently emerged to address this issue by
generating a set of training environments tailored to the agent's capabilities.
While prior works demonstrate that UED has the potential to learn a robust
policy, their performance is constrained by the capabilities of the environment
generation. To this end, we propose a novel UED algorithm, adversarial
environment design via regret-guided diffusion models (ADD). The proposed
method guides the diffusion-based environment generator with the regret of the
agent to produce environments that the agent finds challenging but conducive to
further improvement. By exploiting the representation power of diffusion
models, ADD can directly generate adversarial environments while maintaining
the diversity of training environments, enabling the agent to effectively learn
a robust policy. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
successfully generates an instructive curriculum of environments, outperforming
UED baselines in zero-shot generalization across novel, out-of-distribution

definition of rule quality which is analyzed in detail. The other important
steps of the proposed subgroup discovery process are the detection of
statistically significant properties of selected subgroups and subgroup
visualization: statistically significant properties are used to enrich the
descriptions of induced subgroups, while the visualization shows subgroup
properties in the form of distributions of the numbers of examples in the
subgroups. The approach is illustrated by the results obtained for a medical
problem of early detection of patient risk groups.",2011-06-22,2011,2011-06,medical
"Modeling Multiple Annotator Expertise in the Semi-Supervised Learning
  Scenario","Learning algorithms normally assume that there is at most one annotation or
label per data point. However, in some scenarios, such as medical diagnosis and
on-line collaboration,multiple annotations may be available. In either case,
obtaining labels for data points can be expensive and time-consuming (in some
circumstances ground-truth may not exist). Semi-supervised learning approaches
have shown that utilizing the unlabeled data is often beneficial in these
cases. This paper presents a probabilistic semi-supervised model and algorithm
that allows for learning from both unlabeled and labeled data in the presence
of multiple annotators. We assume that it is known what annotator labeled which
data points. The proposed approach produces annotator models that allow us to
provide (1) estimates of the true label and (2) annotator variable expertise
for both labeled and unlabeled data. We provide numerical comparisons under
various scenarios and with respect to standard semi-supervised learning.
Experiments showed that the presented approach provides clear advantages over
multi-annotator methods that do not use the unlabeled data and over methods
that do not use multi-labeler information.",2012-03-15,2012,2012-03,medical
"Demand-Driven Clustering in Relational Domains for Predicting Adverse
  Drug Events","Learning from electronic medical records (EMR) is challenging due to their
relational nature and the uncertain dependence between a patient's past and
future health status. Statistical relational learning is a natural fit for
analyzing EMRs but is less adept at handling their inherent latent structure,
such as connections between related medications or diseases. One way to capture
the latent structure is via a relational clustering of objects. We propose a
novel approach that, instead of pre-clustering the objects, performs a
demand-driven clustering during learning. We evaluate our algorithm on three
real-world tasks where the goal is to use EMRs to predict whether a patient
will have an adverse reaction to a medication. We find that our approach is
more accurate than performing no clustering, pre-clustering, and using
expert-constructed medical heterarchies.",2012-06-27,2012,2012-06,medical
A Non-Parametric Bayesian Method for Inferring Hidden Causes,"We present a non-parametric Bayesian approach to structure learning with
hidden causes. Previous Bayesian treatments of this problem define a prior over
the number of hidden causes and use algorithms such as reversible jump Markov
chain Monte Carlo to move between solutions. In contrast, we assume that the
number of hidden causes is unbounded, but only a finite number influence
observable variables. This makes it possible to use a Gibbs sampler to
approximate the distribution over causal structures. We evaluate the
performance of both approaches in discovering hidden causes in simulated data,
and use our non-parametric approach to discover hidden causes in a real medical
dataset.",2012-06-27,2012,2012-06,medical
Rule Based Expert System for Cerebral Palsy Diagnosis,"The use of Artificial Intelligence is finding prominence not only in core

which reflect the dynamic aspect of the decision, result of the application of
a Medical Decision Support System (MDSS). This system has to make dynamic

"Artificial Intelligence Framework for Simulating Clinical
  Decision-Making: A Markov Decision Process Approach","In the modern healthcare system, rapidly expanding costs/complexity, the
growing myriad of treatment options, and exploding information streams that
often do not effectively reach the front lines hinder the ability to choose
optimal treatment decisions over time. The goal in this paper is to develop a
general purpose (non-disease-specific) computational/artificial intelligence
(AI) framework to address these challenges. This serves two potential
functions: 1) a simulation environment for exploring various healthcare
policies, payment methodologies, etc., and 2) the basis for clinical artificial
intelligence - an AI that can think like a doctor. This approach combines
Markov decision processes and dynamic decision networks to learn from clinical
data and develop complex plans via simulation of alternative sequential
decision paths while capturing the sometimes conflicting, sometimes synergistic
interactions of various components in the healthcare system. It can operate in
partially observable environments (in the case of missing observations or data)
by maintaining belief states about patient health status and functions as an
online agent that plans and re-plans. This framework was evaluated using real
patient data from an electronic health record. Such an AI framework easily
outperforms the current treatment-as-usual (TAU) case-rate/fee-for-service
models of healthcare (Cost per Unit Change: $189 vs. $497) while obtaining a
30-35% increase in patient outcomes. Tweaking certain model parameters further
enhances this advantage, obtaining roughly 50% more improvement for roughly
half the costs. Given careful design and problem formulation, an AI simulation
framework can approximate optimal decisions even in complex and uncertain
environments. Future work is described that outlines potential lines of
research and integration of machine learning algorithms for personalized
medicine.",2013-01-10,2013,2013-01,medical
"Similarity Measures on Preference Structures, Part II: Utility Functions","In previous work cite{Ha98:Towards} we presented a case-based approach to
eliciting and reasoning with preferences. A key issue in this approach is the
definition of similarity between user preferences. We introduced the
probabilistic distance as a measure of similarity on user preferences, and
provided an algorithm to compute the distance between two partially specified
{em value} functions. This is for the case of decision making under {em
certainty}. In this paper we address the more challenging issue of computing
the probabilistic distance in the case of decision making under{em
uncertainty}. We provide an algorithm to compute the probabilistic distance
between two partially specified {em utility} functions. We demonstrate the use
of this algorithm with a medical data set of partially specified patient
preferences,where none of the other existing distancemeasures appear definable.
Using this data set, we also demonstrate that the case-based approach to
preference elicitation isapplicable in domains with uncertainty. Finally, we
provide a comprehensive analytical comparison of the probabilistic distance
with some existing distance measures on preferences.",2013-01-10,2013,2013-01,medical
Multiplicative Factorization of Noisy-Max,"The noisy-or and its generalization noisy-max have been utilized to reduce

which no previous exact inference method has been shown to perform well.",2013-01-23,2013,2013-01,medical
A Temporal Bayesian Network for Diagnosis and Prediction,"Diagnosis and prediction in some domains, like medical and industrial
diagnosis, require a representation that combines uncertainty management and
temporal reasoning. Based on the fact that in many cases there are few state
changes in the temporal range of interest, we propose a novel representation
called Temporal Nodes Bayesian Networks (TNBN). In a TNBN each node represents
an event or state change of a variable, and an arc corresponds to a
causal-temporal relationship. The temporal intervals can differ in number and
size for each temporal node, so this allows multiple granularity. Our approach
is contrasted with a dynamic Bayesian network for a simple medical example. An
empirical evaluation is presented for a more complex problem, a subsystem of a
fossil power plant, in which this approach is used for fault diagnosis and
prediction with good results.",2013-01-23,2013,2013-01,medical
Mini-Bucket Heuristics for Improved Search,"The paper is a second in a series of two papers evaluating the power of a new
scheme that generates search heuristics mechanically. The heuristics are
extracted from an approximation scheme called mini-bucket elimination that was

within Branch-and-Bound search. In the current paper the idea is further
extended and evaluated within Best-First search. The resulting algorithms are
compared on coding and medical diagnosis problems, using varying strength of
the mini-bucket heuristics.
  Our results demonstrate an effective search scheme that permits controlled
tradeoff between preprocessing (for heuristic generation) and search.
Best-first search is shown to outperform Branch-and-Bound, when supplied with
good heuristics, and sufficient memory space.",2013-01-23,2013,2013-01,medical
From Likelihood to Plausibility,"Several authors have explained that the likelihood ratio measures the
strength of the evidence represented by observations in statistical problems.
This idea works fine when the goal is to evaluate the strength of the available
evidence for a simple hypothesis versus another simple hypothesis. However, the
applicability of this idea is limited to simple hypotheses because the
likelihood function is primarily defined on points (simple hypotheses) of the
parameter space. In this paper we define a general weight of evidence that is
applicable to both simple and composite hypotheses. It is based on the
Dempster-Shafer concept of plausibility and is shown to be a generalization of
the likelihood ratio. Functional models are of a fundamental importance for the
general weight of evidence proposed in this paper. The relevant concepts and
ideas are explained by means of a familiar urn problem and the general analysis
of a real-world medical problem is presented.",2013-01-30,2013,2013-01,medical
"Why Is Diagnosis Using Belief Networks Insensitive to Imprecision In
  Probabilities?","Recent research has found that diagnostic performance with Bayesian belief
networks is often surprisingly insensitive to imprecision in the numerical
probabilities. For example, the authors have recently completed an extensive
study in which they applied random noise to the numerical probabilities in a
set of belief networks for medical diagnosis, subsets of the CPCS network, a
subset of the QMR (Quick Medical Reference) focused on liver and bile diseases.
The diagnostic performance in terms of the average probabilities assigned to
the actual diseases showed small sensitivity even to large amounts of noise. In
this paper, we summarize the findings of this study and discuss possible
explanations of this low sensitivity. One reason is that the criterion for
performance is average probability of the true hypotheses, rather than average
error in probability, which is insensitive to symmetric noise distributions.
But, we show that even asymmetric, logodds-normal noise has modest effects. A
second reason is that the gold-standard posterior probabilities are often near
zero or one, and are little disturbed by noise.",2013-02-13,2013,2013-02,medical

Graph-Grammar Assistance for Automated Generation of Influence Diagrams,"One of the most difficult aspects of modeling complex dilemmas in

Computing as compression: the SP theory of intelligence,"This paper provides an overview of the SP theory of intelligence and its
central idea that artificial intelligence, mainstream computing, and much of
human perception and cognition, may be understood as information compression.
  The background and origins of the SP theory are described, and the main
elements of the theory, including the key concept of multiple alignment,
borrowed from bioinformatics but with important differences. Associated with
the SP theory is the idea that redundancy in information may be understood as
repetition of patterns, that compression of information may be achieved via the
matching and unification (merging) of patterns, and that computing and
information compression are both fundamentally probabilistic. It appears that
the SP system is Turing-equivalent in the sense that anything that may be
computed with a Turing machine may, in principle, also be computed with an SP
machine.
  One of the main strengths of the SP theory and the multiple alignment concept
is in modelling concepts and phenomena in artificial intelligence. Within that
area, the SP theory provides a simple but versatile means of representing
different kinds of knowledge, it can model both the parsing and production of
natural language, with potential for the understanding and translation of
natural languages, it has strengths in pattern recognition, with potential in
computer vision, it can model several kinds of reasoning, and it has
capabilities in planning, problem solving, and unsupervised learning.
  The paper includes two examples showing how alternative parsings of an
ambiguous sentence may be modelled as multiple alignments, and another example
showing how the concept of multiple alignment may be applied in medical
diagnosis.",2013-03-08,2013,2013-03,medical

we discuss the language of influence diagrams and a corresponding methodology

"Experiments Using Belief Functions and Weights of Evidence incorporating

for expert modification of belief values originally obtained from data.
Methodological considerations for using belief functions on statistical data

"An Empirical Evaluation of a Randomized Algorithm for Probabilistic
  Inference","In recent years, researchers in decision analysis and artificial intelligence
(Al) have used Bayesian belief networks to build models of expert opinion.
Using standard methods drawn from the theory of computational complexity,
workers in the field have shown that the problem of probabilistic inference in
belief networks is difficult and almost certainly intractable. K N ET, a
software environment for constructing knowledge-based systems within the
axiomatic framework of decision theory, contains a randomized approximation
scheme for probabilistic inference. The algorithm can, in many circumstances,
perform efficient approximate inference in large and richly interconnected
models of medical diagnosis. Unlike previously described stochastic algorithms
for probabilistic inference, the randomized approximation scheme computes a
priori bounds on running time by analyzing the structure and contents of the
belief network. In this article, we describe a randomized algorithm for
probabilistic inference and analyze its performance mathematically. Then, we
devote the major portion of the paper to a discussion of the algorithm's
empirical behavior. The results indicate that the generation of good trials

A Decision-Theoretic Model for Using Scientific Data,"Many Artificial Intelligence systems depend on the agent's updating its
beliefs about the world on the basis of experience. Experiments constitute one
type of experience, so scientific methodology offers a natural environment for
examining the issues attendant to using this class of evidence. This paper
presents a framework which structures the process of using scientific data from
research reports for the purpose of making decisions, using decision analysis
as the basis for the structure and using medical research as the general
scientific domain. The structure extends the basic influence diagram for
updating belief in an object domain parameter of interest by expanding the
parameter into four parts: those of the patient, the population, the study
sample, and the effective study sample. The structure uses biases to perform
the transformation of one parameter into another, so that, for instance,
selection biases, in concert with the population parameter, yield the study
sample parameter. The influence diagram structure provides decision theoretic
justification for practices of good clinical research such as randomized
assignment and blindfolding of care providers. The model covers most research
designs used in medicine: case-control studies, cohort studies, and controlled
clinical trials, and provides an architecture to separate clearly between
statistical knowledge and domain knowledge. The proposed general model can be
the basis for clinical epidemiological advisory systems, when coupled with
heuristic pruning of irrelevant biases; of statistical workstations, when the
computational machinery for calculation of posterior distributions is added;
and of meta-analytic reviews, when multiple studies may impact on a single
population parameter.",2013-03-27,2013,2013-03,medical
A Tractable Inference Algorithm for Diagnosing Multiple Diseases,"We examine a probabilistic model for the diagnosis of multiple diseases. In
the model, diseases and findings are represented as binary variables. Also,
diseases are marginally independent, features are conditionally independent
given disease instances, and diseases interact to produce findings via a noisy

given a set of observed findings, called quickscore, is presented. The time
complexity of the algorithm is O(nm-2m+), where n is the number of diseases, m+
is the number of positive findings and m- is the number of negative findings.
Although the time complexity of quickscore i5 exponential in the number of
positive findings, the algorithm is useful in practice because the number of
observed positive findings is usually far less than the number of diseases
under consideration. Performance results for quickscore applied to a

In this paper we discuss another type of uncertainty: that which is due to
imprecision in the underlying primitives used to represent the knowledge of the
system. In particular, a given word may denote many similar but not identical
entities. Such words are said to be lexically imprecise. Lexical imprecision
has caused widespread problems in many areas. Unless this phenomenon is

Indeed, we use the vector space model to retrieve similar medical image from

"Subsumptive reflection in SNOMED CT: a large description logic-based
  terminology for diagnosis","Description logic (DL) based biomedical terminology (SNOMED CT) is used
routinely in medical practice. However, diagnostic inference using such
terminology is precluded by its complexity. Here we propose a model that
simplifies these inferential components. We propose three concepts that
classify clinical features and examined their effect on inference using SNOMED
CT. We used PAIRS (Physician Assistant Artificial Intelligence Reference
System) database (1964 findings for 485 disorders, 18 397 disease feature
links) for our analysis. We also use a 50-million medical word corpus for
estimating the vectors of disease-feature links. Our major results are 10% of
finding-disorder links are concomitant in both assertion and negation where as
90% are either concomitant in assertion or negation. Logical implications of
PAIRS data on SNOMED CT include 70% of the links do not share any common system
while 18% share organ and 12% share both system and organ. Applications of

"Performance Based Evaluation of Various Machine Learning Classification
  Techniques for Chronic Kidney Disease Diagnosis","Areas where Artificial Intelligence (AI) & related fields are finding their
applications are increasing day by day, moving from core areas of computer
science they are finding their applications in various other domains.In recent
times Machine Learning i.e. a sub-domain of AI has been widely used in order to
assist medical experts and doctors in the prediction, diagnosis and prognosis
of various diseases and other medical disorders. In this manuscript the authors
applied various machine learning algorithms to a problem in the domain of
medical diagnosis and analyzed their efficiency in predicting the results. The
problem selected for the study is the diagnosis of the Chronic Kidney
Disease.The dataset used for the study consists of 400 instances and 24
attributes. The authors evaluated 12 classification techniques by applying them
to the Chronic Kidney Disease data. In order to calculate efficiency, results
of the prediction by candidate methods were compared with the actual medical
results of the subject.The various metrics used for performance evaluation are
predictive accuracy, precision, sensitivity and specificity. The results

"Harmonization of conflicting medical opinions using argumentation
  protocols and textual entailment - a case study on Parkinson disease","Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease,
affecting more than 1.2 million people in Europe. Medications are available for
the management of its symptoms, but the exact cause of the disease is unknown
and there is currently no cure on the market. To better understand the
relations between new findings and current medical knowledge, we need tools
able to analyse published medical papers based on natural language processing
and tools capable to identify various relationships of new findings with the
current medical knowledge. Our work aims to fill the above technological gap.
  To identify conflicting information in medical documents, we enact textual
entailment technology. To encapsulate existing medical knowledge, we rely on
ontologies. To connect the formal axioms in ontologies with natural text in
medical articles, we exploit ontology verbalisation techniques. To assess the
level of disagreement between human agents with respect to a medical issue, we
rely on fuzzy aggregation. To harmonize this disagreement, we design mediation
protocols within a multi-agent framework.",2016-07-27,2016,2016-07,medical
"Mining Arguments from Cancer Documents Using Natural Language Processing
  and Ontologies","In the medical domain, the continuous stream of scientific research contains
contradictory results supported by arguments and counter-arguments. As medical
expertise occurs at different levels, part of the human agents have
difficulties to face the huge amount of studies, but also to understand the
reasons and pieces of evidences claimed by the proponents and the opponents of
the debated topic. To better understand the supporting arguments for new
findings related to current state of the art in the medical domain we need
tools able to identify arguments in scientific papers. Our work here aims to
fill the above technological gap.
  Quite aware of the difficulty of this task, we embark to this road by relying
on the well-known interleaving of domain knowledge with natural language
processing. To formalise the existing medical knowledge, we rely on ontologies.
To structure the argumentation model we use also the expressivity and reasoning
capabilities of Description Logics. To perform argumentation mining we
formalise various linguistic patterns in a rule-based language. We tested our
solution against a corpus of scientific papers related to breast cancer. The
run experiments show a F-measure between 0.71 and 0.86 for identifying
conclusions of an argument and between 0.65 and 0.86 for identifying premises
of an argument.",2016-07-27,2016,2016-07,medical

"Learning and inference in knowledge-based probabilistic model for
  medical diagnosis","Based on a weighted knowledge graph to represent first-order knowledge and
combining it with a probabilistic model, we propose a methodology for the
creation of a medical knowledge network (MKN) in medical diagnosis. When a set
of symptoms is activated for a specific patient, we can generate a ground
medical knowledge network composed of symptom nodes and potential disease
nodes. By Incorporating a Boltzmann machine into the potential function of a
Markov network, we investigated the joint probability distribution of the MKN.
In order to deal with numerical symptoms, a multivariate inference model is
presented that uses conditional probability. In addition, the weights for the
knowledge graph were efficiently learned from manually annotated Chinese
Electronic Medical Records (CEMRs). In our experiments, we found numerically
that the optimum choice of the quality of disease node and the expression of
symptom variable can improve the effectiveness of medical diagnosis. Our
experimental results comparing a Markov logic network and the logistic
regression algorithm on an actual CEMR database indicate that our method holds

People on Drugs: Credibility of User Statements in Health Communities,"Online health communities are a valuable source of information for patients

inaccuracies and misinformation. In this work we propose a method for
automatically establishing the credibility of user-generated medical statements
and the trustworthiness of their authors by exploiting linguistic cues and
distant supervision from expert sources. To this end we introduce a
probabilistic graphical model that jointly learns user trustworthiness,
statement credibility, and language objectivity. We apply this methodology to
the task of extracting rare or unknown side-effects of medical drugs --- this
being one of the problems where large scale non-expert data has the potential
to complement expert medical knowledge. We show that our method can reliably
extract side-effects and filter out false statements, while identifying
trustworthy users that are likely to contribute valuable medical information.",2017-05-06,2017,2017-05,medical
Brain Intelligence: Go Beyond Artificial Intelligence,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is an important technology that supports daily
social life and economic activities. It contributes greatly to the sustainable
growth of Japan's economy and solves various social problems. In recent years,
AI has attracted attention as a key for growth in developed countries such as
Europe and the United States and developing countries such as China and India.
The attention has been focused mainly on developing new artificial intelligence
information communication technology (ICT) and robot technology (RT). Although
recently developed AI technology certainly excels in extracting certain
patterns, there are many limitations. Most ICT models are overly dependent on
big data, lack a self-idea function, and are complicated. In this paper, rather
than merely developing next-generation artificial intelligence technology, we
aim to develop a new concept of general-purpose intelligence cognition
technology called Beyond AI. Specifically, we plan to develop an intelligent

"Explainable Artificial Intelligence: Understanding, Visualizing and

learning methodology, the performance of AI systems is reaching or even
exceeding the human level on an increasing number of complex tasks. Impressive
examples of this development can be found in domains such as image
classification, sentiment analysis, speech understanding or strategic game
playing. However, because of their nested non-linear structure, these highly
successful machine learning and artificial intelligence models are usually
applied in a black box manner, i.e., no information is provided about what
exactly makes them arrive at their predictions. Since this lack of transparency
can be a major drawback, e.g., in medical applications, the development of
methods for visualizing, explaining and interpreting deep learning models has
recently attracted increasing attention. This paper summarizes recent
developments in this field and makes a plea for more interpretability in
artificial intelligence. Furthermore, it presents two approaches to explaining
predictions of deep learning models, one method which computes the sensitivity

"Determining Positive Cancer Rescue Mutations in p53 Based Cancers by
  using Artificial Intelligence","A mutation in a protein-coding gene in DNA can alter the protein structure
coded by the same gene. Structurally altered proteins usually lose their
functions and sometimes gain an undesirable function instead. These types of
mutations and their effects can result in genetic diseases or antibiotic
resistant bacteria, among other health issues. Important curing methods have
been developed for detecting mutations against AIDS as well as genetic
diseases. Another example is the influenza virus. The reasons why a vaccination
developed to fight against influenza does not work the following year are (a)
the mutation of its DNA and (b) the outbreak of the virus after it has been
mutated especially if it is a virus that escaped the vaccinations target. Due
to such reasons, it is highly important to know in advance the location of a
potential mutation in a protein as well as the problems it might cause the
medical sciences. In this study we have used artificial neural networks, which
are one of the latest artificial intelligence technologies, to determine the
effects of cancer mutations. The model we developed has given more successful

"EMR-based medical knowledge representation and inference via Markov
  random fields and distributed representation learning","Objective: Electronic medical records (EMRs) contain an amount of medical
knowledge which can be used for clinical decision support (CDS). Our objective
is a general system that can extract and represent these knowledge contained in
EMRs to support three CDS tasks: test recommendation, initial diagnosis, and
treatment plan recommendation, with the given condition of one patient.
Methods: We extracted four kinds of medical entities from records and
constructed an EMR-based medical knowledge network (EMKN), in which nodes are
entities and edges reflect their co-occurrence in a single record. Three
bipartite subgraphs (bi-graphs) were extracted from the EMKN to support each
task. One part of the bi-graph was the given condition (e.g., symptoms), and
the other was the condition to be inferred (e.g., diseases). Each bi-graph was
regarded as a Markov random field to support the inference. Three lazy energy
functions and one parameter-based energy function were proposed, as well as two
knowledge representation learning-based energy functions, which can provide a
distributed representation of medical entities. Three measures were utilized
for performance evaluation. Results: On the initial diagnosis task, 80.11% of
the test records identified at least one correct disease from top 10
candidates. Test and treatment recommendation results were 87.88% and 92.55%,
respectively. These results altogether indicate that the proposed system
outperformed the baseline methods. The distributed representation of medical
entities does reflect similarity relationships in regards to knowledge level.
Conclusion: Combining EMKN and MRF is an effective approach for general medical
knowledge representation and inference. Different tasks, however, require
designing their energy functions individually.",2017-09-20,2017,2017-09,medical

representativeness of training data, and scrutiny of results (PQRS). The PQRS

"Towards the Augmented Pathologist: Challenges of Explainable-AI in
  Digital Pathology","Digital pathology is not only one of the most promising fields of diagnostic
medicine, but at the same time a hot topic for fundamental research. Digital
pathology is not just the transfer of histopathological slides into digital
representations. The combination of different data sources (images, patient
records, and *omics data) together with current advances in artificial
intelligence/machine learning enable to make novel information accessible and
quantifiable to a human expert, which is not yet available and not exploited in
current medical settings. The grand goal is to reach a level of usable
intelligence to understand the data in the context of an application task,
thereby making machine decisions transparent, interpretable and explainable.
The foundation of such an ""augmented pathologist"" needs an integrated approach:
While machine learning algorithms require many thousands of training examples,
a human expert is often confronted with only a few data points. Interestingly,
humans can learn from such few examples and are able to instantly interpret
complex patterns. Consequently, the grand goal is to combine the possibilities
of artificial intelligence with human intelligence and to find a well-suited
balance between them to enable what neither of them could do on their own. This
can raise the quality of education, diagnosis, prognosis and prediction of
cancer and other diseases. In this paper we describe some (incomplete) research

"Generating retinal flow maps from structural optical coherence
  tomography with artificial intelligence","Despite significant advances in artificial intelligence (AI) for computer
vision, its application in medical imaging has been limited by the burden and

perfusion of the retinal vasculature, to train an AI algorithm to generate
vasculature maps from standard structural optical coherence tomography (OCT)
images of the same retinae, both exceeding the ability and bypassing the need
for expert labeling. Deep learning was able to infer perfusion of
microvasculature from structural OCT images with similar fidelity to OCTA and
significantly better than expert clinicians (P < 0.00001). OCTA suffers from
need of specialized hardware, laborious acquisition protocols, and motion
artifacts; whereas our model works directly from standard OCT which are
ubiquitous and quick to obtain, and allows unlocking of large volumes of
previously collected standard OCT data both in existing clinical trials and
clinical practice. This finding demonstrates a novel application of AI to

"Label-aware Double Transfer Learning for Cross-Specialty Medical Named
  Entity Recognition","We study the problem of named entity recognition (NER) from electronic
medical records, which is one of the most fundamental and critical problems for
medical text mining. Medical records which are written by clinicians from
different specialties usually contain quite different terminologies and writing
styles. The difference of specialties and the cost of human annotation makes it
particularly difficult to train a universal medical NER system. In this paper,
we propose a label-aware double transfer learning framework (La-DTL) for
cross-specialty NER, so that a medical NER system designed for one specialty
could be conveniently applied to another one with minimal annotation efforts.
The transferability is guaranteed by two components: (i) we propose label-aware
MMD for feature representation transfer, and (ii) we perform parameter transfer
with a theoretical upper bound which is also label aware. We conduct extensive
experiments on 12 cross-specialty NER tasks. The experimental results
demonstrate that La-DTL provides consistent accuracy improvement over strong

"Producing radiologist-quality reports for interpretable artificial

medical tasks have focused on visualising the elements that have contributed to

that involves training a simple recurrent neural network model to produce
descriptive sentences to clarify the decision of deep learning classifiers.
  We test our method on the task of detecting hip fractures from frontal pelvic
x-rays. This process requires minimal additional labelling despite producing
text containing elements that the original deep learning classification model
was not specifically trained to detect.
  The experimental results show that: 1) the sentences produced by our method

Medical Concept Embedding with Time-Aware Attention,"Embeddings of medical concepts such as medication, procedure and diagnosis

Previous work on medical concept embedding takes medical concepts and EMRs as

temporal nature of EMR data. On the one hand, two consecutive medical concepts
do not indicate they are temporally close, but the correlations between them

medical concepts often vary greatly (e.g., \textit{common cold} and
\textit{diabetes}). In this paper, we propose to incorporate the temporal
information to embed medical codes. Based on the Continuous Bag-of-Words model,
we employ the attention mechanism to learn a ""soft"" time-aware context window

Finding Similar Medical Questions from Question Answering Websites,"The past few years have witnessed the flourishing of crowdsourced medical

that a large portion of new medical questions cannot be answered in time or
receive only few answers from these websites. On the other hand, we notice that
solved questions have great potential to solve this challenge. Motivated by
these, we propose an end-to-end system that can automatically find similar
questions for unsolved medical questions. By learning the vector presentation
of unsolved questions and their candidate similar questions, the proposed
system outputs similar questions according to the similarity between vector
representations. Through the vector representation, the similar questions are
found at the question level, and the diversity of medical questions expression
issue can be addressed. Further, we handle two more important issues, i.e.,

that each medical question can be considered as a sample from the latent

a multi-pass decoder to integrate structural knowledge for diversity. A series

Exploiting Sentence Embedding for Medical Question Answering,"Despite the great success of word embedding, sentence embedding remains a
not-well-solved problem. In this paper, we present a supervised learning
framework to exploit sentence embedding for the medical question answering
task. The learning framework consists of two main parts: 1) a sentence
embedding producing module, and 2) a scoring module. The former is developed
with contextual self-attention and multi-scale techniques to encode a sentence
into an embedding tensor. This module is shortly called Contextual
self-Attention Multi-scale Sentence Embedding (CAMSE). The latter employs two
scoring strategies: Semantic Matching Scoring (SMS) and Semantic Association
Scoring (SAS). SMS measures similarity while SAS captures association between
sentence pairs: a medical question concatenated with a candidate choice, and a
piece of corresponding supportive evidence. The proposed framework is examined
by two Medical Question Answering(MedicalQA) datasets which are collected from
real-world applications: medical exam and clinical diagnosis based on
electronic medical records (EMR). The comparison results show that our proposed
framework achieved significant improvements compared to competitive baseline
approaches. Additionally, a series of controlled experiments are also conducted

concatenation is used to fuse such information. In this work, we propose
Multimodal DenseNet, a novel architecture for fusing multimodal data. Instead
of focusing on concatenation or early and late fusion, our proposed
architectures fuses information over several layers and gives the model
flexibility in how it combines information from multiple sources. We apply this
architecture to the challenge of polyp characterization and landmark
identification in endoscopy. Features from white light images are fused with
features from narrow band imaging or depth maps. This study demonstrates that
Multimodal DenseNet outperforms monomodal classification as well as other
multimodal fusion techniques by a significant margin on two different datasets.",2018-11-18,2018,2018-11,medical
Model-Based Reinforcement Learning for Sepsis Treatment,"Sepsis is a dangerous condition that is a leading cause of patient mortality.
Treating sepsis is highly challenging, because individual patients respond very
differently to medical interventions and there is no universally agreed-upon
treatment for sepsis. In this work, we explore the use of continuous
state-space model-based reinforcement learning (RL) to discover high-quality
treatment policies for sepsis patients. Our quantitative evaluation reveals
that by blending the treatment strategy discovered with RL with what clinicians
follow, we can obtain improved policies, potentially allowing for better
medical treatment for sepsis.",2018-11-23,2018,2018-11,medical
"XNet: A convolutional neural network (CNN) implementation for medical
  X-Ray image segmentation suitable for small datasets","X-Ray image enhancement, along with many other medical image processing
applications, requires the segmentation of images into bone, soft tissue, and
open beam regions. We apply a machine learning approach to this problem,
presenting an end-to-end solution which results in robust and efficient
inference. Since medical institutions frequently do not have the resources to
process and label the large quantity of X-Ray images usually needed for neural
network training, we design an end-to-end solution for small datasets, while
achieving state-of-the-art results. Our implementation produces an overall
accuracy of 92%, F1 score of 0.92, and an AUC of 0.98, surpassing classical
image processing techniques, such as clustering and entropy based methods,
while improving upon the output of existing neural networks used for
segmentation in non-medical contexts. The code used for this project is

"Outlining the Design Space of Explainable Intelligent Systems for
  Medical Diagnosis","The adoption of intelligent systems creates opportunities as well as
challenges for medical work. On the positive side, intelligent systems have the
potential to compute complex data from patients and generate automated
diagnosis recommendations for doctors. However, medical professionals often
perceive such systems as black boxes and, therefore, feel concerned about
relying on system generated results to make decisions. In this paper, we
contribute to the ongoing discussion of explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) by exploring the concept of explanation from a human-centered
perspective. We hypothesize that medical professionals would perceive a system
as explainable if the system was designed to think and act like doctors. We
report a preliminary interview study that collected six medical professionals'
reflection of how they interact with data for diagnosis and treatment purposes.
Our data reveals when and how doctors prioritize among various types of data as
a central part of their diagnosis process. Based on these findings, we outline
future directions regarding the design of XAI systems in the medical context.",2019-02-16,2019,2019-02,medical
"The Virtual Doctor: An Interactive Artificial Intelligence based on Deep
  Learning for Non-Invasive Prediction of Diabetes","Artificial intelligence (AI) will pave the way to a new era in medicine.
However, currently available AI systems do not interact with a patient, e.g.,
for anamnesis, and thus are only used by the physicians for predictions in
diagnosis or prognosis. However, these systems are widely used, e.g., in
diabetes or cancer prediction. In the current study, we developed an AI that is
able to interact with a patient (virtual doctor) by using a speech recognition
and speech synthesis system and thus can autonomously interact with the
patient, which is particularly important for, e.g., rural areas, where the
availability of primary medical care is strongly limited by low population
densities. As a proof-of-concept, the system is able to predict type 2 diabetes
mellitus (T2DM) based on non-invasive sensors and deep neural networks.
Moreover, the system provides an easy-to-interpret probability estimation for
T2DM for a given patient. Besides the development of the AI, we further

"Parallel Medical Imaging for Intelligent Medical Image Analysis:
  Concepts, Methods, and Applications","There has been much progress in data-driven artificial intelligence
technology for medical image analysis in the last decades. However, it still
remains challenging due to its distinctive complexity of acquiring and
annotating image data, extracting medical domain knowledge, and explaining the
diagnostic decision for medical image analysis. In this paper, we propose a
data-knowledge-driven framework termed as Parallel Medical Imaging (PMI) for
intelligent medical image analysis based on the methodology of interactive
ACP-based parallel intelligence. In the PMI framework, computational
experiments with predictive learning in a data-driven way are conducted to
extract medical knowledge for diagnostic decision support. Artificial imaging
systems are introduced to select and prescriptively generate medical image data
in a knowledge-driven way to utilize medical domain knowledge. Through the
closed-loop optimization based on parallel execution, our proposed PMI
framework can boost the generalization ability and alleviate the limitation of
medical interpretation for diagnostic decisions. Furthermore, we illustrate the
preliminary implementation of PMI method through the case studies of mammogram
analysis and skin lesion image analysis. Experimental results on several public
medical image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed PMI.",2019-03-12,2019,2019-03,medical

Learning More with Less: GAN-based Medical Image Augmentation,"Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based accurate prediction typically
requires large-scale annotated training data. In Medical Imaging, however, both
obtaining medical data and annotating them by expert physicians are
challenging; to overcome this lack of data, Data Augmentation (DA) using
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is essential, since they can synthesize
additional annotated training data to handle small and fragmented medical
images from various scanners--those generated images, realistic but completely
novel, can further fill the real image distribution uncovered by the original
dataset. As a tutorial, this paper introduces GAN-based Medical Image
Augmentation, along with tricks to boost classification/object
detection/segmentation performance using them, based on our experience and
related work. Moreover, we show our first GAN-based DA work using automatic
bounding box annotation, for robust CNN-based brain metastases detection on 256

"MedGCN: Medication recommendation and lab test imputation via graph
  convolutional networks","Laboratory testing and medication prescription are two of the most important
routines in daily clinical practice. Developing an artificial intelligence
system that can automatically make lab test imputations and medication
recommendations can save costs on potentially redundant lab tests and inform
physicians of a more effective prescription. We present an intelligent medical
system (named MedGCN) that can automatically recommend the patients'
medications based on their incomplete lab tests, and can even accurately
estimate the lab values that have not been taken. In our system, we integrate
the complex relations between multiple types of medical entities with their
inherent features in a heterogeneous graph. Then we model the graph to learn a
distributed representation for each entity in the graph based on graph
convolutional networks (GCN). By the propagation of graph convolutional
networks, the entity representations can incorporate multiple types of medical
information that can benefit multiple medical tasks. Moreover, we introduce a
cross regularization strategy to reduce overfitting for multi-task training by
the interaction between the multiple tasks. In this study, we construct a graph
to associate 4 types of medical entities, i.e., patients, encounters, lab
tests, and medications, and applied a graph neural network to learn node
embeddings for medication recommendation and lab test imputation. we validate
our MedGCN model on two real-world datasets: NMEDW and MIMIC-III. The
experimental results on both datasets demonstrate that our model can outperform
the state-of-the-art in both tasks. We believe that our innovative system can
provide a promising and reliable way to assist physicians to make medication

Artificial Intelligence for Pediatric Ophthalmology,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Despite the impressive results of recent artificial
intelligence (AI) applications to general ophthalmology, comparatively less
progress has been made toward solving problems in pediatric ophthalmology using
similar techniques. This article discusses the unique needs of pediatric
ophthalmology patients and how AI techniques can address these challenges,
surveys recent applications of AI to pediatric ophthalmology, and discusses
future directions in the field.
  RECENT FINDINGS: The most significant advances involve the automated
detection of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), yielding results that rival
experts. Machine learning (ML) has also been successfully applied to the
classification of pediatric cataracts, prediction of post-operative
complications following cataract surgery, detection of strabismus and
refractive error, prediction of future high myopia, and diagnosis of reading
disability via eye tracking. In addition, ML techniques have been used for the
study of visual development, vessel segmentation in pediatric fundus images,
and ophthalmic image synthesis.
  SUMMARY: AI applications could significantly benefit clinical care for
pediatric ophthalmology patients by optimizing disease detection and grading,
broadening access to care, furthering scientific discovery, and improving
clinical efficiency. These methods need to match or surpass physician
performance in clinical trials before deployment with patients. Due to
widespread use of closed-access data sets and software implementations, it is
difficult to directly compare the performance of these approaches, and
reproducibility is poor. Open-access data sets and software implementations
could alleviate these issues, and encourage further AI applications to
pediatric ophthalmology.

"Artificial intelligence technology in oncology: a new technological
  paradigm","Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology is based on theory and development of
computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human
intelligence. In this context, deep learning is a family of computational
methods that allow an algorithm to program itself by learning from a large set
of examples that demonstrate the desired behavior. Application of these methods
to medical imaging can assist pathologists in the detection of cancer subtype,
gene mutations and/or metastases for applying appropriate therapies. The
purpose of this study is to show the emerging application of AI in medical
imaging to detect lung and breast cancer. Moreover, this study shows the
comparative evolutionary pathways of this emerging technology for three
critical cancers: lung, breast and thyroid. A main finding of this study is the
recognition that, since the late 1990, the sharp increase of technological
trajectories of AI technology applied in cancer imaging seems to be driven by
high rates of mortality of some types of cancer (e.g., lung and breast) in
order to find new techniques for a more accurate detection, characterization
and monitoring as well as to apply efficiently anticancer therapies that
increase the progression-free survival of patients: the so-called
mortality-driven AI technological trajectories. Results also suggest that this
new technology can generate a technological paradigm shift for diagnostic
assessment of any cancer type. However, application of these methods to medical

"Pre-training of Graph Augmented Transformers for Medication
  Recommendation","Medication recommendation is an important healthcare application. It is
commonly formulated as a temporal prediction task. Hence, most existing works
only utilize longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) from a small number
of patients with multiple visits ignoring a large number of patients with a
single visit (selection bias). Moreover, important hierarchical knowledge such
as diagnosis hierarchy is not leveraged in the representation learning process.
To address these challenges, we propose G-BERT, a new model to combine the
power of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers) for medical code representation and
medication recommendation. We use GNNs to represent the internal hierarchical
structures of medical codes. Then we integrate the GNN representation into a
transformer-based visit encoder and pre-train it on EHR data from patients only
with a single visit. The pre-trained visit encoder and representation are then
fine-tuned for downstream predictive tasks on longitudinal EHRs from patients
with multiple visits. G-BERT is the first to bring the language model
pre-training schema into the healthcare domain and it achieved state-of-the-art
performance on the medication recommendation task.",2019-06-02,2019,2019-06,medical

science. Central challenges being addressed in CAI4CAI include how to integrate
the ensemble of prior knowledge and instantaneous sensory information from

"Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Psychiatry: Qualitative
  Findings from a Global Physician Survey","The potential for machine learning to disrupt the medical profession is the
subject of ongoing debate within biomedical informatics. This study aimed to
explore psychiatrists' opinions about the potential impact of innovations in
artificial intelligence and machine learning on psychiatric practice. In Spring
2019, we conducted a web-based survey of 791 psychiatrists from 22 countries
worldwide. The survey measured opinions about the likelihood future technology
would fully replace physicians in performing ten key psychiatric tasks. This
study involved qualitative descriptive analysis of written response to three
open-ended questions in the survey. Comments were classified into four major
categories in relation to the impact of future technology on
patient-psychiatric interactions, the quality of patient medical care, the
profession of psychiatry, and health systems. Overwhelmingly, psychiatrists
were skeptical that technology could fully replace human empathy. Many
predicted that 'man and machine' would increasingly collaborate in undertaking
clinical decisions, with mixed opinions about the benefits and harms of such an
arrangement. Participants were optimistic that technology might improve
efficiencies and access to care, and reduce costs. Ethical and regulatory
considerations received limited attention. This study presents timely
information of psychiatrists' view about the scope of artificial intelligence

views about the value and impact of future technology with worrying omissions
about practice guidelines, and ethical and regulatory issues.",2019-10-22,2019,2019-10,medical

Medication Regimen Extraction From Medical Conversations,"Extracting relevant information from medical conversations and providing it
to doctors and patients might help in addressing doctor burnout and patient
forgetfulness. In this paper, we focus on extracting the Medication Regimen
(dosage and frequency for medications) discussed in a medical conversation. We
frame the problem as a Question Answering (QA) task and perform comparative
analysis over: a QA approach, a new combined QA and Information Extraction
approach, and other baselines. We use a small corpus of 6,692 annotated
doctor-patient conversations for the task. Clinical conversation corpora are
costly to create, difficult to handle (because of data privacy concerns), and
thus scarce. We address this data scarcity challenge through data augmentation
methods, using publicly available embeddings and pretrain part of the network
on a related task (summarization) to improve the model's performance. Compared
to the baseline, our best-performing models improve the dosage and frequency
extractions' ROUGE-1 F1 scores from 54.28 and 37.13 to 89.57 and 45.94,

"Unsupervised Online Feature Selection for Cost-Sensitive Medical
  Diagnosis","In medical diagnosis, physicians predict the state of a patient by checking
measurements (features) obtained from a sequence of tests, e.g., blood test,
urine test, followed by invasive tests. As tests are often costly, one would
like to obtain only those features (tests) that can establish the presence or
absence of the state conclusively. Another aspect of medical diagnosis is that
we are often faced with unsupervised prediction tasks as the true state of the
patients may not be known. Motivated by such medical diagnosis problems, we
consider a {\it Cost-Sensitive Medical Diagnosis} (CSMD) problem, where the
true state of patients is unknown. We formulate the CSMD problem as a feature
selection problem where each test gives a feature that can be used in a
prediction model. Our objective is to learn strategies for selecting the
features that give the best trade-off between accuracy and costs. We exploit
the `Weak Dominance' property of problem to develop online algorithms that
identify a set of features which provides an `optimal' trade-off between cost
and accuracy of prediction without requiring to know the true state of the
medical condition. Our empirical results validate the performance of our
algorithms on problem instances generated from real-world datasets.",2019-12-25,2019,2019-12,medical
A New Approach for Explainable Multiple Organ Annotation with Few Data,"Despite the recent successes of deep learning, such models are still far from
some human abilities like learning from few examples, reasoning and explaining

introduce a reasoning framework that is based on learning fuzzy relations on a
small dataset for generating explanations. Given a catalogue of relations, it
efficiently induces the most relevant relations and combines them for building
constraints in order to both solve the organ annotation task and generate
explanations. We test our approach on a publicly available dataset of medical
images where several organs are already segmented. A demonstration of our model

"The Risk to Population Health Equity Posed by Automated Decision
  Systems: A Narrative Review","Artificial intelligence is already ubiquitous, and is increasingly being used
to autonomously make ever more consequential decisions. However, there has been
relatively little research into the existing and possible consequences for
population health equity. A narrative review was undertaken using a hermeneutic
approach to explore current and future uses of narrow AI and automated decision
systems (ADS) in medicine and public health, issues that have emerged, and
implications for equity. Accounts reveal a tremendous expectation on AI to
transform medical and public health practices. Prominent demonstrations of AI
capability - particularly in diagnostic decision making, risk prediction, and
surveillance - are stimulating rapid adoption, spurred by COVID-19. Automated
decisions being made have significant consequences for individual and
population health and wellbeing. Meanwhile, it is evident that hazards
including bias, incontestability, and privacy erosion have emerged in sensitive
domains such as criminal justice where narrow AI and ADS are in common use.
Reports of issues arising from their use in health are already appearing. As
the use of ADS in health expands, it is probable that these hazards will
manifest more widely. Bias, incontestability, and privacy erosion give rise to
mechanisms by which existing social, economic and health disparities are
perpetuated and amplified. Consequently, there is a significant risk that use
of ADS in health will exacerbate existing population health inequities. The
industrial scale and rapidity with which ADS can be applied heightens the risk
to population health equity. It is incumbent on health practitioners and policy
makers therefore to explore the potential implications of using ADS, to ensure

healthcare-related BN models have been proposed, and the differences in
approach between the most common medical conditions to which they have been
applied. We found that almost two-thirds of all healthcare BNs are focused on
four conditions: cardiac, cancer, psychological and lung disorders. We believe
that a lack of understanding regarding how BNs work and what they are capable

"Deepfakes for Medical Video De-Identification: Privacy Protection and
  Diagnostic Information Preservation","Data sharing for medical research has been difficult as open-sourcing
clinical data may violate patient privacy. Traditional methods for face
de-identification wipe out facial information entirely, making it impossible to
analyze facial behavior. Recent advancements on whole-body keypoints detection
also rely on facial input to estimate body keypoints. Both facial and body
keypoints are critical in some medical diagnoses, and keypoints invariability
after de-identification is of great importance. Here, we propose a solution
using deepfake technology, the face swapping technique. While this swapping
method has been criticized for invading privacy and portraiture right, it could
conversely protect privacy in medical video: patients' faces could be swapped
to a proper target face and become unrecognizable. However, it remained an open
question that to what extent the swapping de-identification method could affect
the automatic detection of body keypoints. In this study, we apply deepfake
technology to Parkinson's disease examination videos to de-identify subjects,
and quantitatively show that: face-swapping as a de-identification approach is
reliable, and it keeps the keypoints almost invariant, significantly better
than traditional methods. This study proposes a pipeline for video
de-identification and keypoint preservation, clearing up some ethical
restrictions for medical data sharing. This work could make open-source high
quality medical video datasets more feasible and promote future medical
research that benefits our society.",2020-02-07,2020,2020-02,medical

DAISI: Database for AI Surgical Instruction,"Telementoring surgeons as they perform surgery can be essential in the
treatment of patients when in situ expertise is not available. Nonetheless,
expert mentors are often unavailable to provide trainees with real-time medical

provide medical practitioners with the required guidance. However,
AI/autonomous mentoring in medicine has been limited by the availability of
generalizable prediction models, and surgical procedures datasets to train
those models with. This work presents the initial steps towards the development
of an intelligent artificial system for autonomous medical mentoring.
Specifically, we present the first Database for AI Surgical Instruction
(DAISI). DAISI leverages on images and instructions to provide step-by-step
demonstrations of how to perform procedures from various medical disciplines.
The dataset was acquired from real surgical procedures and data from academic
textbooks. We used DAISI to train an encoder-decoder neural network capable of
predicting medical instructions given a current view of the surgery.
Afterwards, the instructions predicted by the network were evaluated using
cumulative BLEU scores and input from expert physicians. According to the BLEU
scores, the predicted and ground truth instructions were as high as 67%
similar. Additionally, expert physicians subjectively assessed the algorithm

"Modeling Rare Interactions in Time Series Data Through Qualitative

highly-dimensional time-series data. However, using the data available for
prediction and decision making is hampered by the current lag in our ability to
uncover and quantify true interactions that explain the outcomes.We are
interested in areas such as intensive care medicine, which are characterised by
i) continuous monitoring of multivariate variables and non-uniform sampling of
data streams, ii) the outcomes are generally governed by interactions between a
small set of rare events, iii) these interactions are not necessarily definable
by specific values (or value ranges) of a given group of variables, but rather,
by the deviations of these values from the normal state recorded over time, iv)
the need to explain the predictions made by the model. Here, while numerous
data mining models have been formulated for outcome prediction, they are unable
to explain their predictions.
  We present a model for uncovering interactions with the highest likelihood of
generating the outcomes seen from highly-dimensional time series data.
Interactions among variables are represented by a relational graph structure,
which relies on qualitative abstractions to overcome non-uniform sampling and
to capture the semantics of the interactions corresponding to the changes and
deviations from normality of variables of interest over time. Using the

"Unifying Neural Learning and Symbolic Reasoning for Spinal Medical
  Report Generation","Automated medical report generation in spine radiology, i.e., given spinal
medical images and directly create radiologist-level diagnosis reports to
support clinical decision making, is a novel yet fundamental study in the
domain of artificial intelligence in healthcare. However, it is incredibly
challenging because it is an extremely complicated task that involves visual
perception and high-level reasoning processes. In this paper, we propose the
neural-symbolic learning (NSL) framework that performs human-like learning by
unifying deep neural learning and symbolic logical reasoning for the spinal
medical report generation. Generally speaking, the NSL framework firstly
employs deep neural learning to imitate human visual perception for detecting
abnormalities of target spinal structures. Concretely, we design an adversarial
graph network that interpolates a symbolic graph reasoning module into a
generative adversarial network through embedding prior domain knowledge,
achieving semantic segmentation of spinal structures with high complexity and
variability. NSL secondly conducts human-like symbolic logical reasoning that
realizes unsupervised causal effect analysis of detected entities of
abnormalities through meta-interpretive learning. NSL finally fills these
discoveries of target diseases into a unified template, successfully achieving
a comprehensive medical report generation. When it employed in a real-world
clinical dataset, a series of empirical studies demonstrate its capacity on
spinal medical report generation as well as show that our algorithm remarkably
exceeds existing methods in the detection of spinal structures. These indicate
its potential as a clinical tool that contributes to computer-aided diagnosis.",2020-04-28,2020,2020-04,medical

"The Threats of Artificial Intelligence Scale (TAI). Development,
  Measurement and Test Over Three Application Domains","In recent years Artificial Intelligence (AI) has gained much popularity, with
the scientific community as well as with the public. AI is often ascribed many
positive impacts for different social domains such as medicine and the economy.
On the other side, there is also growing concern about its precarious impact on
society and individuals. Several opinion polls frequently query the public fear

regard to the reach and consequences of AI functionalities and the domain of
application, research still lacks necessary precision of a respective
measurement that allows for wide-spread research applicability. We propose a
fine-grained scale to measure threat perceptions of AI that accounts for four

Medical idioms for clinical Bayesian network development,"Bayesian Networks (BNs) are graphical probabilistic models that have proven
popular in medical applications. While numerous medical BNs have been
published, most are presented fait accompli without explanation of how the
network structure was developed or justification of why it represents the
correct structure for the given medical application. This means that the
process of building medical BNs from experts is typically ad hoc and offers
little opportunity for methodological improvement. This paper proposes
generally applicable and reusable medical reasoning patterns to aid those
developing medical BNs. The proposed method complements and extends the
idiom-based approach introduced by Neil, Fenton, and Nielsen in 2000. We
propose instances of their generic idioms that are specific to medical BNs. We
refer to the proposed medical reasoning patterns as medical idioms. In
addition, we extend the use of idioms to represent interventional and
counterfactual reasoning. We believe that the proposed medical idioms are
logical reasoning patterns that can be combined, reused and applied generically
to help develop medical BNs. All proposed medical idioms have been illustrated
using medical examples on coronary artery disease. The method has also been
applied to other ongoing BNs being developed with medical experts. Finally, we
show that applying the proposed medical idioms to published BN models results
in models with a clearer structure.",2020-07-01,2020,2020-07,medical
"Automatic Detection and Classification of Waste Consumer Medications for
  Proper Management and Disposal","Every year, millions of pounds of medicines remain unused in the U.S. and are
subject to an in-home disposal, i.e., kept in medicine cabinets, flushed in
toilet or thrown in regular trash. In-home disposal, however, can negatively
impact the environment and public health. The drug take-back programs (drug
take-backs) sponsored by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and its
state and industry partners collect unused consumer medications and provide the
best alternative to in-home disposal of medicines. However, the drug take-backs
are expensive to operate and not widely available. In this paper, we show that
artificial intelligence (AI) can be applied to drug take-backs to render them
operationally more efficient. Since identification of any waste is crucial to a
proper disposal, we showed that it is possible to accurately identify loose
consumer medications solely based on the physical features and visual
appearance. We have developed an automatic technique that uses deep neural
networks and computer vision to identify and segregate solid medicines. We
applied the technique to images of about one thousand loose pills and succeeded
in correctly identifying the pills with an accuracy of 0.912 and top-5 accuracy
of 0.984. We also showed that hazardous pills could be distinguished from
non-hazardous pills within the dataset with an accuracy of 0.984. We believe
that the power of artificial intelligence could be harnessed in products that
would facilitate the operation of the drug take-backs more efficiently and help
them become widely available throughout the country.",2020-07-27,2020,2020-07,medical

architecture, sparse and noisy labels, federating learning, interpretability,
uncertainty quantification, etc. Then, we present several case studies that are

"ExplAIn: Explanatory Artificial Intelligence for Diabetic Retinopathy
  Diagnosis","In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has proven its relevance for
medical decision support. However, the ""black-box"" nature of successful AI
algorithms still holds back their wide-spread deployment. In this paper, we
describe an eXplanatory Artificial Intelligence (XAI) that reaches the same
level of performance as black-box AI, for the task of classifying Diabetic
Retinopathy (DR) severity using Color Fundus Photography (CFP). This algorithm,
called ExplAIn, learns to segment and categorize lesions in images; the final
image-level classification directly derives from these multivariate lesion
segmentations. The novelty of this explanatory framework is that it is trained
from end to end, with image supervision only, just like black-box AI
algorithms: the concepts of lesions and lesion categories emerge by themselves.
For improved lesion localization, foreground/background separation is trained
through self-supervision, in such a way that occluding foreground pixels
transforms the input image into a healthy-looking image. The advantage of such
an architecture is that automatic diagnoses can be explained simply by an image
and/or a few sentences. ExplAIn is evaluated at the image level and at the
pixel level on various CFP image datasets. We expect this new framework, which
jointly offers high classification performance and explainability, to
facilitate AI deployment.",2020-08-13,2020,2020-08,medical
Survey of XAI in digital pathology,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown great promise for diagnostic imaging

several contributions. Firstly, we give a thorough overview of current XAI
techniques of potential relevance for deep learning methods in pathology
imaging, and categorise them from three different aspects. In doing so, we
incorporate uncertainty estimation methods as an integral part of the XAI

prediction uses the information obtained in the current medical visit. However,
on the other hand, medical history reveals each patient's unique
characteristics and comprehensive medical information. The goal of this study
is to assess personalized ADE risks that a target drug may induce on a target
patient, based on patient medical history recorded in claims codes, which
provide information about diagnosis, drugs taken, related medical supplies

"Dr. Summarize: Global Summarization of Medical Dialogue by Exploiting
  Local Structures","Understanding a medical conversation between a patient and a physician poses
a unique natural language understanding challenge since it combines elements of
standard open ended conversation with very domain specific elements that
require expertise and medical knowledge. Summarization of medical conversations
is a particularly important aspect of medical conversation understanding since
it addresses a very real need in medical practice: capturing the most important
aspects of a medical encounter so that they can be used for medical decision
making and subsequent follow ups.
  In this paper we present a novel approach to medical conversation
summarization that leverages the unique and independent local structures
created when gathering a patient's medical history. Our approach is a variation
of the pointer generator network where we introduce a penalty on the generator
distribution, and we explicitly model negations. The model also captures
important properties of medical conversations such as medical knowledge coming
from standardized medical ontologies better than when those concepts are
introduced explicitly. Through evaluation by doctors, we show that our approach
is preferred on twice the number of summaries to the baseline pointer generator
model and captures most or all of the information in 80% of the conversations

"Basic principles and concept design of a real-time clinical decision
  support system for managing medical emergencies on missions to Mars","Space agencies and private companies prepare the beginning of human space
exploration for the 2030s with missions to put the first human on the Mars

previously unseen manifestations may arise. The current healthcare strategy
based on telemedicine and the possibility to stabilize and transport the

applicable in exploration class missions. Therefore, the need for deploying the
full autonomous capability to solve medical emergencies may guide the design of
future onboard healthcare systems. We present ten basic principles and concept
design of a software suite to bring onboard decision support to help the crew
dealing with medical emergencies taking into consideration physiological
disturbances in space and spaceflight restrictions. 1) give real-time support
for emergency medical decision making, 2) give patient-specific advice for

walking at a patient entity, which connects the KG based on the patient current
diseases or risk factors and stops at a disease entity, which represents the
predicted disease. The trajectory generated by the object represents an

for crisis teams, e.g., comparison with their own local planning, simulation of
local events, simulation of several scenarios (worst / best case). There are
benefits for medical professionals, e.g, analysis of the pandemic at local,
regional, state and federal level, the consideration of special risk groups,
tools for validating the length of stays and transition probabilities. Finally,
there are potential advantages for administration, management, e.g., assessment
of the situation of individual hospitals taking local events into account,
consideration of relevant resources such as beds, ventilators, rooms,
protective clothing, and personnel planning, e.g., medical and nursing staff.
babsim.hospital combines simulation, optimization, statistics, and artificial
intelligence processes in a very efficient way. The core is a discrete,
event-based simulation model.",2020-12-14,2020,2020-12,medical
"DeepKeyGen: A Deep Learning-based Stream Cipher Generator for Medical
  Image Encryption and Decryption","The need for medical image encryption is increasingly pronounced, for example
to safeguard the privacy of the patients' medical imaging data. In this paper,
a novel deep learning-based key generation network (DeepKeyGen) is proposed as
a stream cipher generator to generate the private key, which can then be used
for encrypting and decrypting of medical images. In DeepKeyGen, the generative
adversarial network (GAN) is adopted as the learning network to generate the
private key. Furthermore, the transformation domain (that represents the
""style"" of the private key to be generated) is designed to guide the learning
network to realize the private key generation process. The goal of DeepKeyGen
is to learn the mapping relationship of how to transfer the initial image to
the private key. We evaluate DeepKeyGen using three datasets, namely: the
Montgomery County chest X-ray dataset, the Ultrasonic Brachial Plexus dataset,
and the BraTS18 dataset. The evaluation findings and security analysis show
that the proposed key generation network can achieve a high-level security in
generating the private key.",2020-12-21,2020,2020-12,medical
Medical Entity Linking using Triplet Network,"Entity linking (or Normalization) is an essential task in text mining that
maps the entity mentions in the medical text to standard entities in a given
Knowledge Base (KB). This task is of great importance in the medical domain. It
can also be used for merging different medical and clinical ontologies. In this
paper, we center around the problem of disease linking or normalization. This
task is executed in two phases: candidate generation and candidate scoring. In
this paper, we present an approach to rank the candidate Knowledge Base entries
based on their similarity with disease mention. We make use of the Triplet
Network for candidate ranking. While the existing methods have used carefully
generated sieves and external resources for candidate generation, we introduce
a robust and portable candidate generation scheme that does not make use of the
hand-crafted rules. Experimental results on the standard benchmark NCBI disease
dataset demonstrate that our system outperforms the prior methods by a

"GANterfactual - Counterfactual Explanations for Medical Non-Experts
  using Generative Adversarial Learning","With the ongoing rise of machine learning, the need for methods for
explaining decisions made by artificial intelligence systems is becoming a more
and more important topic. Especially for image classification tasks, many
state-of-the-art tools to explain such classifiers rely on visual highlighting
of important areas of the input data. Contrary, counterfactual explanation
systems try to enable a counterfactual reasoning by modifying the input image
in a way such that the classifier would have made a different prediction. By
doing so, the users of counterfactual explanation systems are equipped with a
completely different kind of explanatory information. However, methods for
generating realistic counterfactual explanations for image classifiers are
still rare. Especially in medical contexts, where relevant information often
consists of textural and structural information, high-quality counterfactual
images have the potential to give meaningful insights into decision processes.
In this work, we present GANterfactual, an approach to generate such
counterfactual image explanations based on adversarial image-to-image
translation techniques. Additionally, we conduct a user study to evaluate our
approach in an exemplary medical use case. Our results show that, in the chosen
medical use-case, counterfactual explanations lead to significantly better

"The Medical Authority of AI: A Study of AI-enabled Consumer-facing
  Health Technology","Recently, consumer-facing health technologies such as Artificial Intelligence
(AI)-based symptom checkers (AISCs) have sprung up in everyday healthcare
practice. AISCs solicit symptom information from users and provide medical
suggestions and possible diagnoses, a responsibility that people usually
entrust with real-person authorities such as physicians and expert patients.
Thus, the advent of AISCs begs a question of whether and how they transform the
notion of medical authority in everyday healthcare practice. To answer this
question, we conducted an interview study with thirty AISC users. We found that
users assess the medical authority of AISCs using various factors including
automated decisions and interaction design patterns of AISC apps, associations
with established medical authorities like hospitals, and comparisons with other
health technologies. We reveal how AISCs are used in healthcare delivery,
discuss how AI transforms conventional understandings of medical authority, and
derive implications for designing AI-enabled health technology.",2021-01-12,2021,2021-01,medical
"Artificial Intelligence for Emotion-Semantic Trending and People Emotion
  Detection During COVID-19 Social Isolation","Taking advantage of social media platforms, such as Twitter, this paper
provides an effective framework for emotion detection among those who are
quarantined. Early detection of emotional feelings and their trends help
implement timely intervention strategies. Given the limitations of medical
diagnosis of early emotional change signs during the quarantine period,
artificial intelligence models provide effective mechanisms in uncovering early
signs, symptoms and escalating trends. Novelty of the approach presented herein
is a multitask methodological framework of text data processing, implemented as
a pipeline for meaningful emotion detection and analysis, based on the
Plutchik/Ekman approach to emotion detection and trend detection. We present an

people expressing on twitter both negative and positive emotional semantics.
Semantic trends of safety issues related to staying at home rapidly decreased
within the 28 days and also negative feelings related to friends dying and

A Taxonomy of Explainable Bayesian Networks,"Artificial Intelligence (AI), and in particular, the explainability thereof,
has gained phenomenal attention over the last few years. Whilst we usually do
not question the decision-making process of these systems in situations where
only the outcome is of interest, we do however pay close attention when these
systems are applied in areas where the decisions directly influence the lives
of humans. It is especially noisy and uncertain observations close to the
decision boundary which results in predictions which cannot necessarily be
explained that may foster mistrust among end-users. This drew attention to AI
methods for which the outcomes can be explained. Bayesian networks are
probabilistic graphical models that can be used as a tool to manage
uncertainty. The probabilistic framework of a Bayesian network allows for
explainability in the model, reasoning and evidence. The use of these methods
is mostly ad hoc and not as well organised as explainability methods in the
wider AI research field. As such, we introduce a taxonomy of explainability in
Bayesian networks. We extend the existing categorisation of explainability in
the model, reasoning or evidence to include explanation of decisions. The
explanations obtained from the explainability methods are illustrated by means
of a simple medical diagnostic scenario. The taxonomy introduced in this paper
has the potential not only to encourage end-users to efficiently communicate
outcomes obtained, but also support their understanding of how and, more
importantly, why certain predictions were made.",2021-01-28,2021,2021-01,medical
Diagnosis of Acute Poisoning Using Explainable Artificial Intelligence,"Medical toxicology is the clinical specialty that treats the toxic effects of
substances, be it an overdose, a medication error, or a scorpion sting. The
volume of toxicological knowledge and research has, as with other medical
specialties, outstripped the ability of the individual clinician to entirely
master and stay current with it. The application of machine learning techniques
to medical toxicology is challenging because initial treatment decisions are
often based on a few pieces of textual data and rely heavily on prior
knowledge. ML techniques often do not represent knowledge in a way that is
transparent for the physician, raising barriers to usability. Rule-based
systems and decision tree learning are more transparent approaches, but often
generalize poorly and require expert curation to implement and maintain. Here,
we construct a probabilistic logic network to represent a portion of the
knowledge base of a medical toxicologist. Our approach transparently mimics the
knowledge representation and clinical decision-making of practicing clinicians.
The software, dubbed Tak, performs comparably to humans on straightforward
cases and intermediate difficulty cases, but is outperformed by humans on
challenging clinical cases. Tak outperforms a decision tree classifier at all
levels of difficulty. Probabilistic logic provides one form of explainable

"Reliability Analysis of Artificial Intelligence Systems Using Recurrent
  Events Data from Autonomous Vehicles","Artificial intelligence (AI) systems have become increasingly common and the
trend will continue. Examples of AI systems include autonomous vehicles (AV),
computer vision, natural language processing, and AI medical experts. To allow
for safe and effective deployment of AI systems, the reliability of such
systems needs to be assessed. Traditionally, reliability assessment is based on
reliability test data and the subsequent statistical modeling and analysis. The
availability of reliability data for AI systems, however, is limited because
such data are typically sensitive and proprietary. The California Department of
Motor Vehicles (DMV) oversees and regulates an AV testing program, in which
many AV manufacturers are conducting AV road tests. Manufacturers participating
in the program are required to report recurrent disengagement events to
California DMV. This information is being made available to the public. In this
paper, we use recurrent disengagement events as a representation of the
reliability of the AI system in AV, and propose a statistical framework for
modeling and analyzing the recurrent events data from AV driving tests. We use
traditional parametric models in software reliability and propose a new
nonparametric model based on monotonic splines to describe the event process.
We develop inference procedures for selecting the best models, quantifying
uncertainty, and testing heterogeneity in the event process. We then analyze
the recurrent events data from four AV manufacturers, and make inferences on
the reliability of the AI systems in AV. We also describe how the proposed
analysis can be applied to assess the reliability of other AI systems.",2021-02-02,2021,2021-02,medical
"The Ethical Implications of Shared Medical Decision Making without
  Providing Adequate Computational Support to the Care Provider and to the
  Patient","There is a clear need to involve patients in medical decisions. However,
cognitive psychological research has highlighted the cognitive limitations of
humans with respect to 1. Probabilistic assessment of the patient state and of
potential outcomes of various decisions, 2. Elicitation of the patient utility
function, and 3. Integration of the probabilistic knowledge and of patient
preferences to determine the optimal strategy. Therefore, without adequate
computational support, current shared decision models have severe ethical
deficiencies. An informed consent model unfairly transfers the responsibility
to a patient who does not have the necessary knowledge, nor the integration
capability. A paternalistic model endows with exaggerated power a physician who
might not be aware of the patient preferences, is prone to multiple cognitive
biases, and whose computational integration capability is bounded. Recent
progress in Artificial Intelligence suggests adding a third agent: a computer,
in all deliberative medical decisions: Non emergency medical decisions in which
more than one alternative exists, the patient preferences can be elicited, the
therapeutic alternatives might be influenced by these preferences, medical
knowledge exists regarding the likelihood of the decision outcomes, and there
is sufficient decision time. Ethical physicians should exploit computational
decision support technologies, neither making the decisions solely on their
own, nor shirking their duty and shifting the responsibility to patients in the
name of informed consent. The resulting three way (patient, care provider,
computer) human machine model that we suggest emphasizes the patient
preferences, the physician knowledge, and the computational integration of both
aspects, does not diminish the physician role, but rather brings out the best
in human and machine.",2021-02-03,2021,2021-02,medical

MixSearch. Specifically, we propose a novel approach to mix multiple
small-scale datasets from multiple domains and segmentation tasks to produce a

"MeSIN: Multilevel Selective and Interactive Network for Medication
  Recommendation","Recommending medications for patients using electronic health records (EHRs)
is a crucial data mining task for an intelligent healthcare system. It can
assist doctors in making clinical decisions more efficiently. However, the
inherent complexity of the EHR data renders it as a challenging task: (1)
Multilevel structures: the EHR data typically contains multilevel structures
which are closely related with the decision-making pathways, e.g., laboratory
results lead to disease diagnoses, and then contribute to the prescribed
medications; (2) Multiple sequences interactions: multiple sequences in EHR
data are usually closely correlated with each other; (3) Abundant noise: lots
of task-unrelated features or noise information within EHR data generally
result in suboptimal performance. To tackle the above challenges, we propose a
multilevel selective and interactive network (MeSIN) for medication
recommendation. Specifically, MeSIN is designed with three components. First,
an attentional selective module (ASM) is applied to assign flexible attention
scores to different medical codes embeddings by their relevance to the
recommended medications in every admission. Second, we incorporate a novel
interactive long-short term memory network (InLSTM) to reinforce the
interactions of multilevel medical sequences in EHR data with the help of the
calibrated memory-augmented cell and an enhanced input gate. Finally, we employ
a global selective fusion module (GSFM) to infuse the multi-sourced information
embeddings into final patient representations for medications recommendation.

"Contextualized Keyword Representations for Multi-modal Retinal Image
  Captioning","Medical image captioning automatically generates a medical description to
describe the content of a given medical image. A traditional medical image
captioning model creates a medical description only based on a single medical
image input. Hence, an abstract medical description or concept is hard to be
generated based on the traditional approach. Such a method limits the
effectiveness of medical image captioning. Multi-modal medical image captioning
is one of the approaches utilized to address this problem. In multi-modal
medical image captioning, textual input, e.g., expert-defined keywords, is
considered as one of the main drivers of medical description generation. Thus,
encoding the textual input and the medical image effectively are both important
for the task of multi-modal medical image captioning. In this work, a new
end-to-end deep multi-modal medical image captioning model is proposed.
Contextualized keyword representations, textual feature reinforcement, and
masked self-attention are used to develop the proposed approach. Based on the

Medical Transformer: Universal Brain Encoder for 3D MRI Analysis,"Transfer learning has gained attention in medical image analysis due to
limited annotated 3D medical datasets for training data-driven deep learning

the goal of increasing the health professionals' trust in the black box
predictions. We implemented two post-hoc interpretable machine learning methods
LIME and SHAP and the alternative explanation approach CIU, centered on the
Contextual Value and Utility (CIU). The produced explanations were evaluated
using human evaluation. We conducted three user studies based on the
explanations provided by LIME, SHAP and CIU. Users from different non-medical
backgrounds carried out a series of tests in the web-based survey setting and
stated their experience and understanding of the given explanations. Three user
groups (n=20, 20, 20) with three distinct forms of explanations were
quantitatively analyzed. We have found that, as hypothesized, the CIU
explainable method performed better than both LIME and SHAP methods in terms of
increasing support for human decision-making as well as being more transparent
and thus understandable to users. Additionally, CIU outperformed LIME and SHAP
by generating explanations more rapidly. Our findings suggest that there are
notable differences in human decision-making between various explanation
support settings. In line with that, we present three potential explainable

"Change Matters: Medication Change Prediction with Recurrent Residual
  Networks","Deep learning is revolutionizing predictive healthcare, including
recommending medications to patients with complex health conditions. Existing
approaches focus on predicting all medications for the current visit, which
often overlaps with medications from previous visits. A more clinically
relevant task is to identify medication changes.
  In this paper, we propose a new recurrent residual network, named MICRON, for
medication change prediction. MICRON takes the changes in patient health
records as input and learns to update a hidden medication vector and the
medication set recurrently with a reconstruction design. The medication vector
is like the memory cell that encodes longitudinal information of medications.
Unlike traditional methods that require the entire patient history for
prediction, MICRON has a residual-based inference that allows for sequential
updating based only on new patient features (e.g., new diagnoses in the recent
visit) more efficiently.
  We evaluated MICRON on real inpatient and outpatient datasets. MICRON
achieves 3.5% and 7.8% relative improvements over the best baseline in F1

large-scale human annotations are usually not available, due to the high costs
and privacy requirements. Hence, current approaches to medical dialogue
generation typically do not explicitly account for patient states and physician
actions, and focus on implicit representation instead. We propose an end-to-end
variational reasoning approach to medical dialogue generation. To be able to
deal with a limited amount of labeled data, we introduce both patient state and
physician action as latent variables with categorical priors for explicit
patient state tracking and physician policy learning, respectively. We propose
a variational Bayesian generative approach to approximate posterior
distributions over patient states and physician actions. We use an efficient
stochastic gradient variational Bayes estimator to optimize the derived
evidence lower bound, where a 2-stage collapsed inference method is proposed to
reduce the bias during model training. A physician policy network composed of
an action-classifier and two reasoning detectors is proposed for augmented
reasoning ability. We conduct experiments on three datasets collected from
medical platforms. Our experimental results show that the proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of objective and subjective
evaluation metrics. Our experiments also indicate that our proposed
semi-supervised reasoning method achieves a comparable performance as
state-of-the-art fully supervised learning baselines for physician policy
learning.",2021-05-13,2021,2021-05,medical
"MedSensor: Medication Adherence Monitoring Using Neural Networks on

"Zero-shot Medical Entity Retrieval without Annotation: Learning From
  Rich Knowledge Graph Semantics","Medical entity retrieval is an integral component for understanding and
communicating information across various health systems. Current approaches
tend to work well on specific medical domains but generalize poorly to unseen
sub-specialties. This is of increasing concern under a public health crisis as
new medical conditions and drug treatments come to light frequently. Zero-shot
retrieval is challenging due to the high degree of ambiguity and variability in
medical corpora, making it difficult to build an accurate similarity measure
between mentions and concepts. Medical knowledge graphs (KG), however, contain
rich semantics including large numbers of synonyms as well as its curated
graphical structures. To take advantage of this valuable information, we
propose a suite of learning tasks designed for training efficient zero-shot
entity retrieval models. Without requiring any human annotation, our knowledge
graph enriched architecture significantly outperforms common zero-shot
benchmarks including BM25 and Clinical BERT with 7% to 30% higher recall across
multiple major medical ontologies, such as UMLS, SNOMED, and ICD-10.",2021-05-26,2021,2021-05,medical
Multi-turn Dialog System on Single-turn Data in Medical Domain,"Recently there has been a huge interest in dialog systems. This interest has

It is difficult to gather a huge amount of multi-turn conversational data in

"Path-based knowledge reasoning with textual semantic information for
  medical knowledge graph completion","Background Knowledge graphs (KGs), especially medical knowledge graphs, are
often significantly incomplete, so it necessitating a demand for medical
knowledge graph completion (MedKGC). MedKGC can find new facts based on the
exited knowledge in the KGs. The path-based knowledge reasoning algorithm is
one of the most important approaches to this task. This type of method has
received great attention in recent years because of its high performance and
interpretability. In fact, traditional methods such as path ranking algorithm
(PRA) take the paths between an entity pair as atomic features. However, the
medical KGs are very sparse, which makes it difficult to model effective
semantic representation for extremely sparse path features. The sparsity in the
medical KGs is mainly reflected in the long-tailed distribution of entities and
paths. Previous methods merely consider the context structure in the paths of
the knowledge graph and ignore the textual semantics of the symbols in the
path. Therefore, their performance cannot be further improved due to the two
aspects of entity sparseness and path sparseness. To address the above issues,
this paper proposes two novel path-based reasoning methods to solve the
sparsity issues of entity and path respectively, which adopts the textual
semantic information of entities and paths for MedKGC. By using the pre-trained
model BERT, combining the textual semantic representations of the entities and
the relationships, we model the task of symbolic reasoning in the medical KG as
a numerical computing issue in textual semantic representation.",2021-05-27,2021,2021-05,medical
"Effect of Pre-Training Scale on Intra- and Inter-Domain Full and
  Few-Shot Transfer Learning for Natural and Medical X-Ray Chest Images","Increasing model, data and compute budget scale in the pre-training has been
shown to strongly improve model generalization and transfer learning in vast
line of work done in language modeling and natural image recognition. However,
most studies on the positive effect of larger scale were done in scope of
in-domain setting, with source and target data being in close proximity. To
study effect of larger scale for both in-domain and out-of-domain setting when
performing full and few-shot transfer, we combine here for the first time
large, openly available medical X-Ray chest imaging datasets to reach a scale
for medical imaging domain comparable to ImageNet-1k, routinely used for
pre-training in natural image domain. We then conduct supervised pre-training,
while varying network size and source data scale and domain, being either large
natural (ImageNet-1k/21k) or large medical chest X-Ray datasets, and transfer
pre-trained models to different natural or medical targets. We observe strong
improvement due to larger pre-training scale for intra-domain natural-natural
and medical-medical transfer. For inter-domain natural-medical transfer, we
find improvements due to larger pre-training scale on larger X-Ray targets in
full shot regime, while for smaller targets and for few-shot regime the
improvement is not visible. Remarkably, large networks pre-trained on very
large natural ImageNet-21k are as good or better than networks pre-trained on
largest available medical X-Ray data when performing transfer to large X-Ray
targets. We conclude that substantially increasing model and generic, medical
domain-agnostic natural image source data scale in the pre-training can enable
high quality out-of-domain transfer to medical domain specific targets,
removing dependency on large medical domain-specific source data often not
available in the practice.",2021-05-31,2021,2021-05,medical

diagnostic judgements. Here we introduce and evaluate explanations based on
Bayesian Teaching, a formal account of explanation rooted in the cognitive
science of human learning. We find that medical experts exposed to explanations
generated by Bayesian Teaching successfully predict the AI's diagnostic

Probing Pre-Trained Language Models for Disease Knowledge,"Pre-trained language models such as ClinicalBERT have achieved impressive
results on tasks such as medical Natural Language Inference. At first glance,
this may suggest that these models are able to perform medical reasoning tasks,
such as mapping symptoms to diseases. However, we find that standard benchmarks
such as MedNLI contain relatively few examples that require such forms of
reasoning. To better understand the medical reasoning capabilities of existing
language models, in this paper we introduce DisKnE, a new benchmark for Disease
Knowledge Evaluation. To construct this benchmark, we annotated each positive
MedNLI example with the types of medical reasoning that are needed. We then
created negative examples by corrupting these positive examples in an
adversarial way. Furthermore, we define training-test splits per disease,
ensuring that no knowledge about test diseases can be learned from the training
data, and we canonicalize the formulation of the hypotheses to avoid the
presence of artefacts. This leads to a number of binary classification
problems, one for each type of reasoning and each disease. When analysing
pre-trained models for the clinical/biomedical domain on the proposed
benchmark, we find that their performance drops considerably.",2021-06-14,2021,2021-06,medical

"Transformer-based unsupervised patient representation learning based on
  medical claims for risk stratification and analysis","The claims data, containing medical codes, services information, and incurred

Multimodal AutoEncoder (TMAE), an unsupervised learning framework that can
learn efficient patient representation by encoding meaningful information from
the claims data. TMAE is motivated by the practical needs in healthcare to
stratify patients into different risk levels for improving care delivery and
management. Compared to previous approaches, TMAE is able to 1) model
inpatient, outpatient, and medication claims collectively, 2) handle irregular
time intervals between medical events, 3) alleviate the sparsity issue of the
rare medical codes, and 4) incorporate medical expenditure information. We
trained TMAE using a real-world pediatric claims dataset containing more than
600,000 patients and compared its performance with various approaches in two
clustering tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that TMAE has superior
performance compared to all baselines. Multiple downstream applications are
also conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of our framework. The promising

"A Method for Medical Data Analysis Using the LogNNet for Clinical

The problem of implementing artificial intelligence on edge devices is the
complexity and high resource intensity of the most known neural network data
analysis methods and algorithms. The difficulty of implementing these methods

of new effective algorithms for neural networks. This study presents a new
method for analyzing medical data based on the LogNNet neural network, which
uses chaotic mappings to transform input information. The method effectively
solves classification problems and calculates risk factors for the presence of
a disease in a patient according to a set of medical health indicators. The
efficiency of LogNNet in assessing perinatal risk is illustrated on
cardiotocogram data obtained from the UC Irvine machine learning repository.
The classification accuracy reaches ~91% with the ~3-10 kB of RAM used on the
Arduino microcontroller. Using the LogNNet network trained on a publicly

"Improvement of a Prediction Model for Heart Failure Survival through
  Explainable Artificial Intelligence","Cardiovascular diseases and their associated disorder of heart failure are
one of the major death causes globally, being a priority for doctors to detect
and predict its onset and medical consequences. Artificial Intelligence (AI)
allows doctors to discover clinical indicators and enhance their diagnosis and
treatments. Specifically, explainable AI offers tools to improve the clinical
prediction models that experience poor interpretability of their results. This
work presents an explainability analysis and evaluation of a prediction model
for heart failure survival by using a dataset that comprises 299 patients who
suffered heart failure. The model employs a data workflow pipeline able to
select the best ensemble tree algorithm as well as the best feature selection
technique. Moreover, different post-hoc techniques have been used for the
explainability analysis of the model. The paper's main contribution is an
explainability-driven approach to select the best prediction model for HF
survival based on an accuracy-explainability balance. Therefore, the most
balanced explainable prediction model implements an Extra Trees classifier over
5 selected features (follow-up time, serum creatinine, ejection fraction, age

cross-validation and new unseen data respectively. The follow-up time is the
most influencing feature followed by serum-creatinine and ejection-fraction.

dialogues that covers multiple medical services and contains fine-grained
medical labels (i.e., intents, actions, slots, values), and (2) there is no set
of established benchmarks for MDSs for multi-domain, multi-service medical

Independent control over both inspiratory and expiratory resistances allows for
the simulation of obstructive breathing disorders through the whole spectrum of
FEV1/FVC spirometry ratios (used to classify COPD), ranging from healthy values
to values seen in severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Moreover,
waveform characteristics of breathing disorders, such as a change in
inspiratory duty cycle or peak flow are also observed in the waveforms

Overall, the proposed apparatus provides us with a simple, effective and

Predicting COVID-19 Patient Shielding: A Comprehensive Study,"There are many ways machine learning and big data analytics are used in the
fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, including predictions, risk management,
diagnostics, and prevention. This study focuses on predicting COVID-19 patient
shielding -- identifying and protecting patients who are clinically extremely
vulnerable from coronavirus. This study focuses on techniques used for the
multi-label classification of medical text. Using the information published by
the United Kingdom NHS and the World Health Organisation, we present a novel
approach to predicting COVID-19 patient shielding as a multi-label
classification problem. We use publicly available, de-identified ICU medical
text data for our experiments. The labels are derived from the published
COVID-19 patient shielding data. We present an extensive comparison across 12
multi-label classifiers from the simple binary relevance to neural networks and
the most recent transformers. To the best of our knowledge this is the first
comprehensive study, where such a range of multi-label classifiers for medical
text are considered. We highlight the benefits of various approaches, and argue
that, for the task at hand, both predictive accuracy and processing time are
essential.",2021-10-01,2021,2021-10,medical
"Application of quantum computing to a linear non-Gaussian acyclic model
  for novel medical knowledge discovery","Recently, with the digitalization of medicine, the utilization of real-world
medical data collected from clinical sites has been attracting attention. In
this study, quantum computing was applied to a linear non-Gaussian acyclic
model to discover causal relationships from real-world medical data alone.
Specifically, the independence measure of DirectLiNGAM, a causal discovery
algorithm, was calculated using the quantum kernel and its accuracy on
real-world medical data was verified. When DirectLiNGAM with the quantum kernel
(qLiNGAM) was applied to real-world medical data, a case was confirmed in which
the causal structure could be correctly estimated when the amount of data was
small, which was not possible with existing methods. Furthermore, qLiNGAM was
implemented on real quantum hardware in an experiment using IBMQ. It is
suggested that qLiNGAM may be able to discover new medical knowledge and
contribute to the solution of medical problems, even when only a small amount
of data is available.",2021-10-09,2021,2021-10,medical

mask-mapping-based non-maximum suppression method are proposed to achieve a
feasible and efficient medication detector aiming at arbitrarily oriented

Circle Representation for Medical Object Detection,"Box representation has been extensively used for object detection in computer
vision. Such representation is efficacious but not necessarily optimized for
biomedical objects (e.g., glomeruli), which play an essential role in renal
pathology. In this paper, we propose a simple circle representation for medical
object detection and introduce CircleNet, an anchor-free detection framework.
Compared with the conventional bounding box representation, the proposed
bounding circle representation innovates in three-fold: (1) it is optimized for
ball-shaped biomedical objects; (2) The circle representation reduced the
degree of freedom compared with box representation; (3) It is naturally more
rotation invariant. When detecting glomeruli and nuclei on pathological images,
the proposed circle representation achieved superior detection performance and

  Lower-resource Areas","Importance: Lower-resource areas in Africa and Asia face a unique set of
healthcare challenges: the dual high burden of communicable and
non-communicable diseases; a paucity of highly trained primary healthcare
providers in both rural and densely populated urban areas; and a lack of
reliable, inexpensive internet connections. Objective: To address these
challenges, we designed an artificial intelligence assistant to help primary
healthcare providers in lower-resource areas document demographic and medical
sign/symptom data and to record and share diagnostic data in real-time with a
centralized database. Design: We trained our system using multiple data sets,
including US-based electronic medical records (EMRs) and open-source medical
literature and developed an adaptive, general medical assistant system based on
machine learning algorithms. Main outcomes and Measure: The application
collects basic information from patients and provides primary care providers
with diagnoses and prescriptions suggestions. The application is unique from
existing systems in that it covers a wide range of common diseases, signs, and
medication typical in lower-resource countries; the application works with or
without an active internet connection. Results: We have built and implemented
an adaptive learning system that assists trained primary care professionals by
means of an Android smartphone application, which interacts with a central
database and collects real-time data. The application has been tested by dozens
of primary care providers. Conclusions and Relevance: Our application would

Auto-Encoding Knowledge Graph for Unsupervised Medical Report Generation,"Medical report generation, which aims to automatically generate a long and
coherent report of a given medical image, has been receiving growing research
interests. Existing approaches mainly adopt a supervised manner and heavily
rely on coupled image-report pairs. However, in the medical domain, building a
large-scale image-report paired dataset is both time-consuming and expensive.
To relax the dependency on paired data, we propose an unsupervised model
Knowledge Graph Auto-Encoder (KGAE) which accepts independent sets of images
and reports in training. KGAE consists of a pre-constructed knowledge graph, a
knowledge-driven encoder and a knowledge-driven decoder. The knowledge graph
works as the shared latent space to bridge the visual and textual domains; The
knowledge-driven encoder projects medical images and reports to the
corresponding coordinates in this latent space and the knowledge-driven decoder
generates a medical report given a coordinate in this space. Since the
knowledge-driven encoder and decoder can be trained with independent sets of
images and reports, KGAE is unsupervised. The experiments show that the
unsupervised KGAE generates desirable medical reports without using any
image-report training pairs. Moreover, KGAE can also work in both
semi-supervised and supervised settings, and accept paired images and reports
in training. By further fine-tuning with image-report pairs, KGAE consistently
outperforms the current state-of-the-art models on two datasets.",2021-11-08,2021,2021-11,medical
"Measuring Outcomes in Healthcare Economics using Artificial

"Interactive Medical Image Segmentation with Self-Adaptive Confidence
  Calibration","Medical image segmentation is one of the fundamental problems for artificial
intelligence-based clinical decision systems. Current automatic medical image
segmentation methods are often failed to meet clinical requirements. As such, a

corrective action evaluation, which combines the action-based confidence
learning and multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). The evaluation is
established through a novel action-based confidence network, and the corrective

"Improving Predictions of Tail-end Labels using Concatenated
  BioMed-Transformers for Long Medical Documents","Multi-label learning predicts a subset of labels from a given label set for
an unseen instance while considering label correlations. A known challenge with
multi-label classification is the long-tailed distribution of labels. Many
studies focus on improving the overall predictions of the model and thus do not
prioritise tail-end labels. Improving the tail-end label predictions in
multi-label classifications of medical text enables the potential to understand
patients better and improve care. The knowledge gained by one or more
infrequent labels can impact the cause of medical decisions and treatment
plans. This research presents variations of concatenated domain-specific
language models, including multi-BioMed-Transformers, to achieve two primary
goals. First, to improve F1 scores of infrequent labels across multi-label
problems, especially with long-tail labels; second, to handle long medical text

standard transformers designed to work on short input sequences. A vital

"Label-dependent and event-guided interpretable disease risk prediction
  using EHRs","Electronic health records (EHRs) contain patients' heterogeneous data that
are collected from medical providers involved in the patient's care, including
medical notes, clinical events, laboratory test results, symptoms, and
diagnoses. In the field of modern healthcare, predicting whether patients would
experience any risks based on their EHRs has emerged as a promising research
area, in which artificial intelligence (AI) plays a key role. To make AI models
practically applicable, it is required that the prediction results should be
both accurate and interpretable. To achieve this goal, this paper proposed a
label-dependent and event-guided risk prediction model (LERP) to predict the
presence of multiple disease risks by mainly extracting information from
unstructured medical notes. Our model is featured in the following aspects.
First, we adopt a label-dependent mechanism that gives greater attention to
words from medical notes that are semantically similar to the names of risk
labels. Secondly, as the clinical events (e.g., treatments and drugs) can also
indicate the health status of patients, our model utilizes the information from
events and uses them to generate an event-guided representation of medical
notes. Thirdly, both label-dependent and event-guided representations are
integrated to make a robust prediction, in which the interpretability is
enabled by the attention weights over words from medical notes. To demonstrate
the applicability of the proposed method, we apply it to the MIMIC-III dataset,

"Benchmark datasets driving artificial intelligence development fail to
  capture the needs of medical professionals","Publicly accessible benchmarks that allow for assessing and comparing model
performances are important drivers of progress in artificial intelligence (AI).
While recent advances in AI capabilities hold the potential to transform
medical practice by assisting and augmenting the cognitive processes of
healthcare professionals, the coverage of clinically relevant tasks by AI
benchmarks is largely unclear. Furthermore, there is a lack of systematized
meta-information that allows clinical AI researchers to quickly determine
accessibility, scope, content and other characteristics of datasets and
benchmark datasets relevant to the clinical domain.
  To address these issues, we curated and released a comprehensive catalogue of
datasets and benchmarks pertaining to the broad domain of clinical and
biomedical natural language processing (NLP), based on a systematic review of
literature and online resources. A total of 450 NLP datasets were manually
systematized and annotated with rich metadata, such as targeted tasks, clinical
applicability, data types, performance metrics, accessibility and licensing
information, and availability of data splits. We then compared tasks covered by
AI benchmark datasets with relevant tasks that medical practitioners reported
as highly desirable targets for automation in a previous empirical study.
  Our analysis indicates that AI benchmarks of direct clinical relevance are
scarce and fail to cover most work activities that clinicians want to see
addressed. In particular, tasks associated with routine documentation and
patient data administration workflows are not represented despite significant
associated workloads. Thus, currently available AI benchmarks are improperly

"Label Dependent Attention Model for Disease Risk Prediction Using
  Multimodal Electronic Health Records","Disease risk prediction has attracted increasing attention in the field of
modern healthcare, especially with the latest advances in artificial
intelligence (AI). Electronic health records (EHRs), which contain
heterogeneous patient information, are widely used in disease risk prediction
tasks. One challenge of applying AI models for risk prediction lies in
generating interpretable evidence to support the prediction results while
retaining the prediction ability. In order to address this problem, we propose
the method of jointly embedding words and labels whereby attention modules
learn the weights of words from medical notes according to their relevance to
the names of risk prediction labels. This approach boosts interpretability by
employing an attention mechanism and including the names of prediction tasks in
the model. However, its application is only limited to the handling of textual
inputs such as medical notes. In this paper, we propose a label dependent
attention model LDAM to 1) improve the interpretability by exploiting
Clinical-BERT (a biomedical language model pre-trained on a large clinical
corpus) to encode biomedically meaningful features and labels jointly; 2)
extend the idea of joint embedding to the processing of time-series data, and
develop a multi-modal learning framework for integrating heterogeneous
information from medical notes and time-series health status indicators. To

the decision process of DNN, most of them only focus on the pixel-level
features and do not take into account the medical prior knowledge. In this
work, we propose an interpretable framework based on key medical concepts,
which provides explanations from the perspective of clinicians' cognition.
Moreover, we utilize a concept-based graph convolutional neural(GCN) network to
construct the relationships between key medical concepts. Extensive
experimental analysis on a private dataset has shown that the proposed method

"Distantly supervised end-to-end medical entity extraction from
  electronic health records with human-level quality","Medical entity extraction (EE) is a standard procedure used as a first stage
in medical texts processing. Usually Medical EE is a two-step process: named
entity recognition (NER) and named entity normalization (NEN). We propose a
novel method of doing medical EE from electronic health records (EHR) as a
single-step multi-label classification task by fine-tuning a transformer model
pretrained on a large EHR dataset. Our model is trained end-to-end in an
distantly supervised manner using targets automatically extracted from medical
knowledge base. We show that our model learns to generalize for entities that
are present frequently enough, achieving human-level classification quality for
most frequent entities. Our work demonstrates that medical entity extraction
can be done end-to-end without human supervision and with human quality given
the availability of a large enough amount of unlabeled EHR and a medical
knowledge base.",2022-01-25,2022,2022-01,medical
"An Analysis on Ensemble Learning optimized Medical Image Classification
  with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","Novel and high-performance medical image classification pipelines are heavily
utilizing ensemble learning strategies. The idea of ensemble learning is to
assemble diverse models or multiple predictions and, thus, boost prediction
performance. However, it is still an open question to what extent as well as
which ensemble learning strategies are beneficial in deep learning based
medical image classification pipelines. In this work, we proposed a
reproducible medical image classification pipeline for analyzing the
performance impact of the following ensemble learning techniques: Augmenting,
Stacking, and Bagging. The pipeline consists of state-of-the-art preprocessing
and image augmentation methods as well as 9 deep convolution neural network
architectures. It was applied on four popular medical imaging datasets with
varying complexity. Furthermore, 12 pooling functions for combining multiple
predictions were analyzed, ranging from simple statistical functions like
unweighted averaging up to more complex learning-based functions like support
vector machines. Our results revealed that Stacking achieved the largest
performance gain of up to 13% F1-score increase. Augmenting showed consistent
improvement capabilities by up to 4% and is also applicable to single model
based pipelines. Cross-validation based Bagging demonstrated significant
performance gain close to Stacking, which resulted in an F1-score increase up
to +11%. Furthermore, we demonstrated that simple statistical pooling functions
are equal or often even better than more complex pooling functions. We
concluded that the integration of ensemble learning techniques is a powerful
method for any medical image classification pipeline to improve robustness and
boost performance.",2022-01-27,2022,2022-01,medical
"A Knowledge-Based Decision Support System for In Vitro Fertilization
  Treatment","In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) is the most widely used Assisted Reproductive
Technology (ART). IVF usually involves controlled ovarian stimulation, oocyte
retrieval, fertilization in the laboratory with subsequent embryo transfer. The
first two steps correspond with follicular phase of females and ovulation in
their menstrual cycle. Therefore, we refer to it as the treatment cycle in our
paper. The treatment cycle is crucial because the stimulation medications in
IVF treatment are applied directly on patients. In order to optimize the
stimulation effects and lower the side effects of the stimulation medications,
prompt treatment adjustments are in need. In addition, the quality and quantity
of the retrieved oocytes have a significant effect on the outcome of the
following procedures. To improve the IVF success rate, we propose a
knowledge-based decision support system that can provide medical advice on the
treatment protocol and medication adjustment for each patient visit during IVF
treatment cycle. Our system is efficient in data processing and light-weighted
which can be easily embedded into electronic medical record systems. Moreover,

interpretation guide on the following metrics for medical image segmentation
evaluation in binary as well as multi-class problems: Dice similarity

"Guidelines and Evaluation of Clinical Explainable AI in Medical Image
  Analysis","Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is essential for enabling clinical
users to get informed decision support from AI and comply with evidence-based
medical practice. Applying XAI in clinical settings requires proper evaluation
criteria to ensure the explanation technique is both technically sound and

bridge the research gap, we propose the Clinical XAI Guidelines that consist of
five criteria a clinical XAI needs to be optimized for. The guidelines
recommend choosing an explanation form based on Guideline 1 (G1)
Understandability and G2 Clinical relevance. For the chosen explanation form,
its specific XAI technique should be optimized for G3 Truthfulness, G4
Informative plausibility, and G5 Computational efficiency. Following the
guidelines, we conducted a systematic evaluation on a novel problem of
multi-modal medical image explanation with two clinical tasks, and proposed new

Application of DatasetGAN in medical imaging: preliminary studies,"Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been widely investigated for many
potential applications in medical imaging. DatasetGAN is a recently proposed

synthesized annotated images could be potentially employed for many medical
imaging applications, where images with segmentation information are required.
However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no published studies focusing
on its applications to medical imaging. In this work, preliminary studies were
conducted to investigate the utility of DatasetGAN in medical imaging. Three
improvements were proposed to the original DatasetGAN framework, considering
the unique characteristics of medical images. The synthesized segmented images

Hierarchical BERT for Medical Document Understanding,"Medical document understanding has gained much attention recently. One
representative task is the International Classification of Disease (ICD)
diagnosis code assignment. Existing work adopts either RNN or CNN as the
backbone network because the vanilla BERT cannot handle well long documents
(>2000 to kens). One issue shared across all these approaches is that they are
over specific to the ICD code assignment task, losing generality to give the
whole document-level and sentence-level embedding. As a result, it is not
straight-forward to direct them to other downstream NLU tasks. Motivated by
these observations, we propose Medical Document BERT (MDBERT) for long medical
document understanding tasks. MDBERT is not only effective in learning
representations at different levels of semantics but efficient in encoding long
documents by leveraging a bottom-up hierarchical architecture. Compared to
vanilla BERT solutions: 1, MDBERT boosts the performance up to relatively 20%
on the MIMIC-III dataset, making it comparable to current SOTA solutions; 2, it
cuts the computational complexity on self-attention modules to less than 1/100.
Other than the ICD code assignment, we conduct a variety of other NLU tasks on
a large commercial dataset named as TrialTrove, to showcase MDBERT's strength
in delivering different levels of semantics.",2022-03-11,2022,2022-03,medical
"Evaluating Explainable AI on a Multi-Modal Medical Imaging Task: Can
  Existing Algorithms Fulfill Clinical Requirements?","Being able to explain the prediction to clinical end-users is a necessity to
leverage the power of artificial intelligence (AI) models for clinical decision
support. For medical images, a feature attribution map, or heatmap, is the most
common form of explanation that highlights important features for AI models'
prediction. However, it is unknown how well heatmaps perform on explaining
decisions on multi-modal medical images, where each image modality or channel
visualizes distinct clinical information of the same underlying biomedical
phenomenon. Understanding such modality-dependent features is essential for
clinical users' interpretation of AI decisions. To tackle this clinically
important but technically ignored problem, we propose the modality-specific
feature importance (MSFI) metric. It encodes clinical image and explanation
interpretation patterns of modality prioritization and modality-specific
feature localization. We conduct a clinical requirement-grounded, systematic
evaluation using computational methods and a clinician user study. Results show
that the examined 16 heatmap algorithms failed to fulfill clinical requirements

Understanding the data generation process could help to create artificial

"Optimally Designing Cybersecurity Insurance Contracts to Encourage the
  Sharing of Medical Data","Though the sharing of medical data has the potential to lead to breakthroughs
in health care, the sharing process itself exposes patients and health care
providers to various risks. Patients face risks due to the possible loss in
privacy or livelihood that can occur when medical data is stolen or used in
non-permitted ways, whereas health care providers face risks due to the
associated liability. For medical data, these risks persist even after
anonymizing/deidentifying, according to the standards defined in existing
legislation, the data sets prior to sharing, because shared medical data can
often be deanonymized/reidentified using advanced artificial intelligence and
machine learning methodologies. As a result, health care providers are hesitant
to share medical data. One possible solution to encourage health care providers

contracts. This paper studies the problem of designing optimal cybersecurity
insurance contracts, with the goal of encouraging the sharing of the medical

scenarios, derive the optimal contract, discuss its implications, and perform
numerical case studies. In particular, we consider two scenarios: the first
scenario is where a health care provider is selling medical data to a

"IOP-FL: Inside-Outside Personalization for Federated Medical Image
  Segmentation","Federated learning (FL) allows multiple medical institutions to
collaboratively learn a global model without centralizing client data. It is
difficult, if possible at all, for such a global model to commonly achieve
optimal performance for each individual client, due to the heterogeneity of
medical images from various scanners and patient demographics. This problem
becomes even more significant when deploying the global model to unseen clients
outside the FL with unseen distributions not presented during federated
training. To optimize the prediction accuracy of each individual client for
medical imaging tasks, we propose a novel unified framework for both
\textit{Inside and Outside model Personalization in FL} (IOP-FL). Our inside
personalization uses a lightweight gradient-based approach that exploits the
local adapted model for each client, by accumulating both the global gradients
for common knowledge and the local gradients for client-specific optimization.
Moreover, and importantly, the obtained local personalized models and the
global model can form a diverse and informative routing space to personalize an
adapted model for outside FL clients. Hence, we design a new test-time routing
scheme using the consistency loss with a shape constraint to dynamically

"MedFACT: Modeling Medical Feature Correlations in Patient Health
  Representation Learning via Feature Clustering","In healthcare prediction tasks, it is essential to exploit the correlations
between medical features and learn better patient health representations.
Existing methods try to estimate feature correlations only from data, or
increase the quality of estimation by introducing task-specific medical

correlations due to insufficient training samples, or cannot be generalized to
other tasks due to reliance on specific knowledge. There are medical research
revealing that not all the medical features are strongly correlated. Thus, to

Masked Image Modeling Advances 3D Medical Image Analysis,"Recently, masked image modeling (MIM) has gained considerable attention due
to its capacity to learn from vast amounts of unlabeled data and has been
demonstrated to be effective on a wide variety of vision tasks involving

modeling 3D medical images is anticipated to be immense due to the high
quantities of unlabeled images, and the expense and difficulty of quality
labels. However, MIM's applicability to medical images remains uncertain. In
this paper, we demonstrate that masked image modeling approaches can also
advance 3D medical images analysis in addition to natural images. We study how
masked image modeling strategies leverage performance from the viewpoints of 3D
medical image segmentation as a representative downstream task: i) when
compared to naive contrastive learning, masked image modeling approaches
accelerate the convergence of supervised training even faster (1.40$\times$)
and ultimately produce a higher dice score; ii) predicting raw voxel values
with a high masking ratio and a relatively smaller patch size is non-trivial
self-supervised pretext-task for medical images modeling; iii) a lightweight

"CATNet: Cross-event Attention-based Time-aware Network for Medical Event
  Prediction","Medical event prediction (MEP) is a fundamental task in the medical domain,
which needs to predict medical events, including medications, diagnosis codes,
laboratory tests, procedures, outcomes, and so on, according to historical
medical records. The task is challenging as medical data is a type of complex
time series data with heterogeneous and temporal irregular characteristics.
Many machine learning methods that consider the two characteristics have been
proposed for medical event prediction. However, most of them consider the two
characteristics separately and ignore the correlations among different types of
medical events, especially relations between historical medical events and
target medical events. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network based
on attention mechanism, called cross-event attention-based time-aware network

irregular characteristics locally and globally respectively, 2) taking full
advantage of correlations among different types of events via cross-event

concatenated embeddings using both ImageNet pre-trained weights and CheXpert
pre-trained weights. We use BLEU(1-4), ROUGE-L, CIDEr, and the clinical
CheXbert F1 scores to validate our models and demonstrate competitive scores
with state of the art models. We provide evidence that ImageNet pre-training is
ill-suited for the medical image captioning task, especially for less frequent
conditions (eg: enlarged cardiomediastinum, lung lesion, pneumothorax).
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the double feature model improves performance
for specific medical conditions (edema, consolidation, pneumothorax, support
devices) and overall CheXbert F1 score, and should be further developed in
future work. Such a double feature model, including both ImageNet pre-training
as well as domain specific pre-training, could be used in a wide range of image

"Deep Supervised Information Bottleneck Hashing for Cross-modal Retrieval
  based Computer-aided Diagnosis","Mapping X-ray images, radiology reports, and other medical data as binary
codes in the common space, which can assist clinicians to retrieve
pathology-related data from heterogeneous modalities (i.e., hashing-based
cross-modal medical data retrieval), provides a new view to promot
computeraided diagnosis. Nevertheless, there remains a barrier to boost medical
retrieval accuracy: how to reveal the ambiguous semantics of medical data
without the distraction of superfluous information. To circumvent this
drawback, we propose Deep Supervised Information Bottleneck Hashing (DSIBH),
which effectively strengthens the discriminability of hash codes. Specifically,
the Deep Deterministic Information Bottleneck (Yu, Yu, and Principe 2021) for
single modality is extended to the cross-modal scenario. Benefiting from this,
the superfluous information is reduced, which facilitates the discriminability
of hash codes. Experimental results demonstrate the superior accuracy of the
proposed DSIBH compared with state-of-the-arts in cross-modal medical data
retrieval tasks.",2022-05-06,2022,2022-05,medical

"Explainable Deep Learning Methods in Medical Image Classification: A
  Survey","The remarkable success of deep learning has prompted interest in its
application to medical imaging diagnosis. Even though state-of-the-art deep
learning models have achieved human-level accuracy on the classification of
different types of medical data, these models are hardly adopted in clinical
workflows, mainly due to their lack of interpretability. The black-box-ness of
deep learning models has raised the need for devising strategies to explain the
decision process of these models, leading to the creation of the topic of
eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). In this context, we provide a
thorough survey of XAI applied to medical imaging diagnosis, including visual,
textual, example-based and concept-based explanation methods. Moreover, this
work reviews the existing medical imaging datasets and the existing metrics for
evaluating the quality of the explanations. In addition, we include a

"Using artificial intelligence to detect chest X-rays with no significant
  findings in a primary health care setting in Oulu, Finland","Objectives: To assess the use of artificial intelligence-based software in
ruling out chest X-ray cases, with no significant findings in a primary health
care setting.
  Methods: In this retrospective study, a commercially available artificial
intelligence (AI) software was used to analyse 10 000 chest X-rays of Finnish
primary health care patients. In studies with a mismatch between an AI normal
report and the original radiologist report, a consensus read by two
board-certified radiologists was conducted to make the final diagnosis.
  Results: After the exclusion of cases not meeting the study criteria, 9579
cases were analysed by AI. Of these cases, 4451 were considered normal in the
original radiologist report and 4644 after the consensus reading. The number of
cases correctly found nonsignificant by AI was 1692 (17.7% of all studies and
36.4% of studies with no significant findings). After the consensus read, there
were nine confirmed false-negative studies. These studies included four cases
of slightly enlarged heart size, four cases of slightly increased pulmonary
opacification and one case with a small unilateral pleural effusion. This gives
the AI a sensitivity of 99.8% (95% CI= 99.65-99.92) and specificity of 36.4 %
(95% CI= 35.05-37.84) for recognising significant pathology on a chest X-ray.
  Conclusions: AI was able to correctly rule out 36.4% of chest X-rays with no
significant findings of primary health care patients, with a minimal number of
false negatives that would lead to effectively no compromise on patient safety.
No critical findings were missed by the software.",2022-05-17,2022,2022-05,medical
Robust and Efficient Medical Imaging with Self-Supervision,"Recent progress in Medical Artificial Intelligence (AI) has delivered systems
that can reach clinical expert level performance. However, such systems tend to
demonstrate sub-optimal ""out-of-distribution"" performance when evaluated in
clinical settings different from the training environment. A common mitigation
strategy is to develop separate systems for each clinical setting using
site-specific data [1]. However, this quickly becomes impractical as medical
data is time-consuming to acquire and expensive to annotate [2]. Thus, the
problem of ""data-efficient generalization"" presents an ongoing difficulty for
Medical AI development. Although progress in representation learning shows
promise, their benefits have not been rigorously studied, specifically for
out-of-distribution settings. To meet these challenges, we present REMEDIS, a
unified representation learning strategy to improve robustness and
data-efficiency of medical imaging AI. REMEDIS uses a generic combination of
large-scale supervised transfer learning with self-supervised learning and
requires little task-specific customization. We study a diverse range of
medical imaging tasks and simulate three realistic application scenarios using
retrospective data. REMEDIS exhibits significantly improved in-distribution
performance with up to 11.5% relative improvement in diagnostic accuracy over a
strong supervised baseline. More importantly, our strategy leads to strong
data-efficient generalization of medical imaging AI, matching strong supervised
baselines using between 1% to 33% of retraining data across tasks. These
results suggest that REMEDIS can significantly accelerate the life-cycle of
medical imaging AI development thereby presenting an important step forward for
medical imaging AI to deliver broad impact.",2022-05-19,2022,2022-05,medical
"Preparing data for pathological artificial intelligence with
  clinical-grade performance","[Purpose] The pathology is decisive for disease diagnosis, but relies heavily
on the experienced pathologists. Recently, pathological artificial intelligence
(PAI) is thought to improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. However, the
high performance of PAI based on deep learning in the laboratory generally
cannot be reproduced in the clinic. [Methods] Because the data preparation is
important for PAI, the paper has reviewed PAI-related studies in the PubMed
database published from January 2017 to February 2022, and 118 studies were
included. The in-depth analysis of methods for preparing data is performed,
including obtaining slides of pathological tissue, cleaning, screening, and
then digitizing. Expert review, image annotation, dataset division for model
training and validation are also discussed. We further discuss the reasons why
the high performance of PAI is not reproducible in the clinical practices and
show some effective ways to improve clinical performances of PAI. [Results] The
robustness of PAI depend on randomized collection of representative disease
slides, including rigorous quality control and screening, correction of digital
discrepancies, reasonable annotation, and the amount of data. The digital
pathology is fundamental of clinical-grade PAI, and the techniques of data
standardization and weakly supervised learning methods based on whole slide
image (WSI) are effective ways to overcome obstacles of performance
reproduction. [Conclusion] The representative data, the amount of labeling and
consistency from multi-centers is the key to performance reproduction. The
digital pathology for clinical diagnosis, data standardization and technique of
WSI-based weakly supervised learning hopefully build clinical-grade PAI.

  Cardiac Resonance. Validation of a New Artificial Intelligence Approach","Background: Artificial intelligence techniques have shown great potential in
cardiology, especially in quantifying cardiac biventricular function, volume,

coefficient) was observed between manual quantification and the proposed
quantification of cardiac function (0.98, 0.92, 0.96 and 0.8 for volumes and

Future Artificial Intelligence tools and perspectives in medicine,"Purpose of review: Artificial intelligence (AI) has become popular in medical
applications, specifically as a clinical support tool for computer-aided
diagnosis. These tools are typically employed on medical data (i.e., image,
molecular data, clinical variables, etc.) and used the statistical and machine
learning methods to measure the model performance. In this review, we
summarized and discussed the most recent radiomic pipeline used for clinical
analysis. Recent findings:Currently, limited management of cancers benefits
from artificial intelligence, mostly related to a computer-aided diagnosis that
avoids a biopsy analysis that presents additional risks and costs. Most AI
tools are based on imaging features, known as radiomic analysis that can be
refined into predictive models in non-invasively acquired imaging data. This
review explores the progress of AI-based radiomic tools for clinical
applications with a brief description of necessary technical steps. Explaining
new radiomic approaches based on deep learning techniques will explain how the
new radiomic models (deep radiomic analysis) can benefit from deep

"Bootstrapping Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation with
  Anatomical-aware Contrastive Distillation","Contrastive learning has shown great promise over annotation scarcity
problems in the context of medical image segmentation. Existing approaches
typically assume a balanced class distribution for both labeled and unlabeled
medical images. However, medical image data in reality is commonly imbalanced
(i.e., multi-class label imbalance), which naturally yields blurry contours and
usually incorrectly labels rare objects. Moreover, it remains unclear whether
all negative samples are equally negative. In this work, we present ACTION, an
Anatomical-aware ConTrastive dIstillatiON framework, for semi-supervised
medical image segmentation. Specifically, we first develop an iterative
contrastive distillation algorithm by softly labeling the negatives rather than
binary supervision between positive and negative pairs. We also capture more
semantically similar features from the randomly chosen negative set compared to
the positives to enforce the diversity of the sampled data. Second, we raise a
more important question: Can we really handle imbalanced samples to yield
better performance? Hence, the key innovation in ACTION is to learn global
semantic relationship across the entire dataset and local anatomical features
among the neighbouring pixels with minimal additional memory footprint. During
the training, we introduce anatomical contrast by actively sampling a sparse
set of hard negative pixels, which can generate smoother segmentation
boundaries and more accurate predictions. Extensive experiments across two
benchmark datasets and different unlabeled settings show that ACTION
significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods.",2022-06-06,2022,2022-06,medical
"Implementation of a Modified U-Net for Medical Image Segmentation on
  Edge Devices","Deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks, have
shown great potential in computer vision and medical imaging applications.
However, deep learning models are computationally demanding as they require
enormous computational power and specialized processing hardware for model
training. To make these models portable and compatible for prototyping, their
implementation on low-power devices is imperative. In this work, we present the
implementation of Modified U-Net on Intel Movidius Neural Compute Stick 2
(NCS-2) for the segmentation of medical images. We selected U-Net because, in
medical image segmentation, U-Net is a prominent model that provides improved
performance for medical image segmentation even if the dataset size is small.
The modified U-Net model is evaluated for performance in terms of dice score.
Experiments are reported for segmentation task on three medical imaging
datasets: BraTs dataset of brain MRI, heart MRI dataset, and Ziehl-Neelsen
sputum smear microscopy image (ZNSDB) dataset. For the proposed model, we
reduced the number of parameters from 30 million in the U-Net model to 0.49
million in the proposed architecture. Experimental results show that the
modified U-Net provides comparable performance while requiring significantly
lower resources and provides inference on the NCS-2. The maximum dice scores

"Improving Medical Systems in the United States using Knowledge-Based
  Systems","America has one of the best medical systems in the world. The medical
treatment care options offered by the medical system make it sophisticated.
However, many American patients are not receiving health care on a regular
basis, and at the same time, they cannot afford it. Also, the current medical
system has many flaws such as high medical treatment costs and lack of doctors
to accommodate many patients. This paper presents the principles of medical
artificial intelligence called the knowledge based system. Doctors can remotely
check and monitor their patients health data, medical history, how and what
medical tests were done, and the lab results. The patients have access to
detailed health information online and do not need to make an appointment with
doctors to check their health on a daily basis. One doctor can check many
patients simultaneously online (when medical centers are understaffed) and do
not need to spend a lot of time with patients. Thus, doctors save more money
for patients, because patients will no longer be transporting to medical
centers to receive routine health check-ups. Patients do not need to overpay
for their insurance because they will have access to the knowledge-based
system, and the system will save the patients money to have their health
checked and reduce the number of unnecessary medical exams. This paper

Medical Dialogue Response Generation with Pivotal Information Recalling,"Medical dialogue generation is an important yet challenging task. Most
previous works rely on the attention mechanism and large-scale pretrained
language models. However, these methods often fail to acquire pivotal
information from the long dialogue history to yield an accurate and informative
response, due to the fact that the medical entities usually scatters throughout
multiple utterances along with the complex relationships between them. To
mitigate this problem, we propose a medical response generation model with
Pivotal Information Recalling (MedPIR), which is built on two components, i.e.,
knowledge-aware dialogue graph encoder and recall-enhanced generator. The
knowledge-aware dialogue graph encoder constructs a dialogue graph by
exploiting the knowledge relationships between entities in the utterances, and
encodes it with a graph attention network. Then, the recall-enhanced generator
strengthens the usage of these pivotal information by generating a summary of
the dialogue before producing the actual response. Experimental results on two
large-scale medical dialogue datasets show that MedPIR outperforms the strong
baselines in BLEU scores and medical entities F1 measure.",2022-06-17,2022,2022-06,medical

"Backdoor Attack is a Devil in Federated GAN-based Medical Image
  Synthesis","Deep Learning-based image synthesis techniques have been applied in
healthcare research for generating medical images to support open research.
Training generative adversarial neural networks (GAN) usually requires large
amounts of training data. Federated learning (FL) provides a way of training a
central model using distributed data from different medical institutions while
keeping raw data locally. However, FL is vulnerable to backdoor attack, an
adversarial by poisoning training data, given the central server cannot access
the original data directly. Most backdoor attack strategies focus on
classification models and centralized domains. In this study, we propose a way
of attacking federated GAN (FedGAN) by treating the discriminator with a
commonly used data poisoning strategy in backdoor attack classification models.
We demonstrate that adding a small trigger with size less than 0.5 percent of
the original image size can corrupt the FL-GAN model. Based on the proposed
attack, we provide two effective defense strategies: global malicious detection

"Complementary artificial intelligence designed to augment human
  discovery","Neither artificial intelligence designed to play Turing's imitation game, nor
augmented intelligence built to maximize the human manipulation of information
are tuned to accelerate innovation and improve humanity's collective advance
against its greatest challenges. We reconceptualize and pilot beneficial AI to
radically augment human understanding by complementing rather than competing
with human cognitive capacity. Our approach to complementary intelligence
builds on insights underlying the wisdom of crowds, which hinges on the
independence and diversity of crowd members' information and approach. By
programmatically incorporating information on the evolving distribution of
scientific expertise from research papers, our approach follows the
distribution of content in the literature while avoiding the scientific crowd
and the hypotheses cognitively available to it. We use this approach to
generate valuable predictions for what materials possess valuable
energy-related properties (e.g., thermoelectricity), and what compounds possess
valuable medical properties (e.g., asthma) that complement the human scientific
crowd. We demonstrate that our complementary predictions, if identified by
human scientists and inventors at all, are only discovered years further into
the future. When we evaluate the promise of our predictions with
first-principles equations, we demonstrate that increased complementarity of
our predictions does not decrease and in some cases increases the probability
that the predictions possess the targeted properties. In summary, by tuning AI
to avoid the crowd, we can generate hypotheses unlikely to be imagined or
pursued until the distant future and promise to punctuate scientific advance.

For the classification mission, the max accuracy of Swin-T by regular training

"Self-supervised Multi-modal Training from Uncurated Image and Reports
  Enables Zero-shot Oversight Artificial Intelligence in Radiology","Oversight AI is an emerging concept in radiology where the AI forms a
symbiosis with radiologists by continuously supporting radiologists in their
decision-making. Recent advances in vision-language models sheds a light on the
long-standing problems of the oversight AI by the understanding both visual and
textual concepts and their semantic correspondences. However, there have been
limited successes in the application of vision-language models in the medical
domain, as the current vision-language models and learning strategies for
photographic images and captions call for the web-scale data corpus of image
and text pairs which was not often feasible in the medical domain. To address
this, here we present a model dubbed Medical Cross-attention Vision-Language
model (Medical X-VL), leveraging the key components to be tailored for the
medical domain. Our medical X-VL model is based on the following components:
self-supervised uni-modal models in medical domain and fusion encoder to bridge
them, momentum distillation, sentence-wise contrastive learning for medical
reports, and the sentence similarity-adjusted hard negative mining. We
experimentally demonstrated that our model enables various zero-shot tasks for
oversight AI, ranging from the zero-shot classification to zero-shot error
correction. Our model outperformed the current state-of-the-art models in two
different medical image database, suggesting the novel clinical usage of our
oversight AI model for monitoring human errors. Our method was especially

Intelligence (XAI) offers methods to provide explanations of internal functions
of algorithms and reasons behind their decisions in ways that are interpretable

developed thus far, and a comparative analysis of these strategies seems
necessary to discern their relevance to clinical prediction models. To this
end, we first implemented two prediction models for short- and long-term
outcomes of traumatic brain injury (TBI) utilizing structured tabular as well
as time-series physiologic data, respectively. Six different interpretation
techniques were used to describe both prediction models at the local and global
levels. We then performed a critical analysis of merits and drawbacks of each
strategy, highlighting the implications for researchers who are interested in
applying these methodologies. The implemented methods were compared to one
another in terms of several XAI characteristics such as understandability,

"DR.BENCH: Diagnostic Reasoning Benchmark for Clinical Natural Language
  Processing","The meaningful use of electronic health records (EHR) continues to progress
in the digital era with clinical decision support systems augmented by
artificial intelligence. A priority in improving provider experience is to
overcome information overload and reduce the cognitive burden so fewer medical
errors and cognitive biases are introduced during patient care. One major type
of medical error is diagnostic error due to systematic or predictable errors in
judgment that rely on heuristics. The potential for clinical natural language
processing (cNLP) to model diagnostic reasoning in humans with forward
reasoning from data to diagnosis and potentially reduce the cognitive burden

"Compressed Gastric Image Generation Based on Soft-Label Dataset
  Distillation for Medical Data Sharing","Background and objective: Sharing of medical data is required to enable the
cross-agency flow of healthcare information and construct high-accuracy
computer-aided diagnosis systems. However, the large sizes of medical datasets,
the massive amount of memory of saved deep convolutional neural network (DCNN)
models, and patients' privacy protection are problems that can lead to
inefficient medical data sharing. Therefore, this study proposes a novel
soft-label dataset distillation method for medical data sharing.
  Methods: The proposed method distills valid information of medical image data
and generates several compressed images with different data distributions for
anonymous medical data sharing. Furthermore, our method can extract essential
weights of DCNN models to reduce the memory required to save trained models for
efficient medical data sharing.
  Results: The proposed method can compress tens of thousands of images into
several soft-label images and reduce the size of a trained model to a few
hundredths of its original size. The compressed images obtained after
distillation have been visually anonymized; therefore, they do not contain the
private information of the patients. Furthermore, we can realize high-detection
performance with a small number of compressed images.
  Conclusions: The experimental results show that the proposed method can
improve the efficiency and security of medical data sharing.",2022-09-29,2022,2022-09,medical
"Medical Image Retrieval via Nearest Neighbor Search on Pre-trained Image

points is large. The NNS has multiple applications in medicine, such as
searching large medical imaging databases, disease classification, diagnosis,

effective and efficient algorithm that searches and retrieves the relevant
images from heterogeneous sources of medical images. Towards this, given a
medical database, the proposed algorithm builds the index that consists of
pre-computed links of each point in the database. The search algorithm utilizes
the index to efficiently traverse the database in search of the nearest

performance with state-of-the-art NNS approaches on benchmark datasets and our
created medical image datasets. The proposed approach outperformed the existing
approach in terms of retrieving accurate neighbors and retrieval speed. We also

Token Classification for Disambiguating Medical Abbreviations,"Abbreviations are unavoidable yet critical parts of the medical text. Using
abbreviations, especially in clinical patient notes, can save time and space,
protect sensitive information, and help avoid repetitions. However, most
abbreviations might have multiple senses, and the lack of a standardized
mapping system makes disambiguating abbreviations a difficult and
time-consuming task. The main objective of this study is to examine the
feasibility of token classification methods for medical abbreviation
disambiguation. Specifically, we explore the capability of token classification
methods to deal with multiple unique abbreviations in a single text. We use two
public datasets to compare and contrast the performance of several transformer
models pre-trained on different scientific and medical corpora. Our proposed
token classification approach outperforms the more commonly used text
classification models for the abbreviation disambiguation task. In particular,
the SciBERT model shows a strong performance for both token and text
classification tasks over the two considered datasets. Furthermore, we find
that abbreviation disambiguation performance for the text classification models

"Adapting Pretrained Vision-Language Foundational Models to Medical

Building generative models for medical images that faithfully depict clinical
context may help alleviate the paucity of healthcare datasets. Thus, in this
study, we seek to research and expand the representational capabilities of
large pretrained foundation models to medical concepts, specifically for
leveraging the Stable Diffusion model to generate domain specific images found
in medical imaging. We explore the sub-components of the Stable Diffusion
pipeline (the variational autoencoder, the U-Net and the text-encoder) to
fine-tune the model to generate medical images. We benchmark the efficacy of
these efforts using quantitative image quality metrics and qualitative
radiologist-driven evaluations that accurately represent the clinical content
of conditional text prompts. Our best-performing model improves upon the stable
diffusion baseline and can be conditioned to insert a realistic-looking

context-preserving cut-paste strategy, we could create valid training data as
measured by performance of the resulting trained model on the benchmark test

similarly to those trained using traditional data augmentation (FETAL-125

perform augmentations during training time, as well as the ability to apply
chosen augmentations equally across data classes, are important considerations

the naturally exhibited semantic correspondences between medical image and

cross-attention strategy to explicitly learn the matching between fine-grained
visual tokens and text tokens, followed by contrastive learning to align them.
More important, to leverage the high-level inter-subject relationship semantic
(e.g., disease) correspondences, we design a novel cross-modal disease-level

patients across different hospitals and to ensure security and privacy of the
user's data. Furthermore, we provide a comparative analysis of different

"Robust Alzheimer's Progression Modeling using Cross-Domain
  Self-Supervised Deep Learning","Developing successful artificial intelligence systems in practice depends on
both robust deep learning models and large, high-quality data. However,
acquiring and labeling data can be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming
in many real-world applications, such as clinical disease models.
Self-supervised learning has demonstrated great potential in increasing model
accuracy and robustness in small data regimes. In addition, many clinical
imaging and disease modeling applications rely heavily on regression of
continuous quantities. However, the applicability of self-supervised learning
for these medical-imaging regression tasks has not been extensively studied. In
this study, we develop a cross-domain self-supervised learning approach for
disease prognostic modeling as a regression problem using medical images as
input. We demonstrate that self-supervised pretraining can improve the
prediction of Alzheimer's Disease progression from brain MRI. We also show that
pretraining on extended (but not labeled) brain MRI data outperforms
pretraining on natural images. We further observe that the highest performance
is achieved when both natural images and extended brain-MRI data are used for
pretraining.",2022-11-15,2022,2022-11,medical

Heterogeneous Graph Learning for Multi-modal Medical Data Analysis,"Routine clinical visits of a patient produce not only image data, but also
non-image data containing clinical information regarding the patient, i.e.,

different and complementary perspectives on the same patient, resulting in more
accurate clinical decisions when they are properly combined. However, despite
its significance, how to effectively fuse the multi-modal medical data into a

  Classification","The use of deep learning in computer vision tasks such as image
classification has led to a rapid increase in the performance of such systems.
Due to this substantial increment in the utility of these systems, the use of

high accuracy and near parity with human physicians in many tasks. However,
these artificial intelligence systems are extremely complex and are considered

"SADM: Sequence-Aware Diffusion Model for Longitudinal Medical Image
  Generation","Human organs constantly undergo anatomical changes due to a complex mix of
short-term (e.g., heartbeat) and long-term (e.g., aging) factors. Evidently,
prior knowledge of these factors will be beneficial when modeling their future
state, i.e., via image generation. However, most of the medical image
generation tasks only rely on the input from a single image, thus ignoring the
sequential dependency even when longitudinal data is available. Sequence-aware
deep generative models, where model input is a sequence of ordered and
timestamped images, are still underexplored in the medical imaging domain that
is featured by several unique challenges: 1) Sequences with various lengths; 2)
Missing data or frame, and 3) High dimensionality. To this end, we propose a
sequence-aware diffusion model (SADM) for the generation of longitudinal
medical images. Recently, diffusion models have shown promising results in
high-fidelity image generation. Our method extends this new technique by
introducing a sequence-aware transformer as the conditional module in a
diffusion model. The novel design enables learning longitudinal dependency even
with missing data during training and allows autoregressive generation of a
sequence of images during inference. Our extensive experiments on 3D

"Annotation by Clicks: A Point-Supervised Contrastive Variance Method for

exploited to train segmentation models with less expensive annotations. In this
paper, we propose a novel point-supervised contrastive variance method (PSCV)
for medical image semantic segmentation, which only requires one pixel-point
from each organ category to be annotated. The proposed method trains the base
segmentation network by using a novel contrastive variance (CV) loss to exploit
the unlabeled pixels and a partial cross-entropy loss on the labeled pixels.
The CV loss function is designed to exploit the statistical spatial
distribution properties of organs in medical images and their variance
distribution map representations to enforce discriminative predictions over the
unlabeled pixels. Experimental results on two standard medical image datasets

hybrid of a local differential privacy (LDP) algorithm and one of the
flow-based deep generative models (GLOW). By applying a GLOW model, we
disentangle the pixelwise correlation of images, which makes it difficult to
protect privacy with straightforward LDP algorithms for images. Specifically,
we map images onto the latent vector of the GLOW model, each element of which
follows an independent normal distribution, and we apply the Laplace mechanism

"UnICLAM:Contrastive Representation Learning with Adversarial Masking for
  Unified and Interpretable Medical Vision Question Answering","Medical Visual Question Answering (Medical-VQA) aims to to answer clinical
questions regarding radiology images, assisting doctors with decision-making
options. Nevertheless, current Medical-VQA models learn cross-modal
representations through residing vision and texture encoders in dual separate
spaces, which lead to indirect semantic alignment. In this paper, we propose
UnICLAM, a Unified and Interpretable Medical-VQA model through Contrastive
Representation Learning with Adversarial Masking. Specifically, to learn an
aligned image-text representation, we first establish a unified dual-stream
pre-training structure with the gradually soft-parameter sharing strategy.
Technically, the proposed strategy learns a constraint for the vision and
texture encoders to be close in a same space, which is gradually loosened as
the higher number of layers. Moreover, for grasping the unified semantic
representation, we extend the adversarial masking data augmentation to the
contrastive representation learning of vision and text in a unified manner.
Concretely, while the encoder training minimizes the distance between original
and masking samples, the adversarial masking module keeps adversarial learning
to conversely maximize the distance. Furthermore, we also intuitively take a
further exploration to the unified adversarial masking augmentation model,
which improves the potential ante-hoc interpretability with remarkable
performance and efficiency. Experimental results on VQA-RAD and SLAKE public
benchmarks demonstrate that UnICLAM outperforms existing 11 state-of-the-art

"A New Perspective to Boost Vision Transformer for Medical Image
  Classification","Transformer has achieved impressive successes for various computer vision
tasks. However, most of existing studies require to pretrain the Transformer
backbone on a large-scale labeled dataset (e.g., ImageNet) for achieving
satisfactory performance, which is usually unavailable for medical images.
Additionally, due to the gap between medical and natural images, the
improvement generated by the ImageNet pretrained weights significantly degrades
while transferring the weights to medical image processing tasks. In this
paper, we propose Bootstrap Own Latent of Transformer (BOLT), a self-supervised
learning approach specifically for medical image classification with the
Transformer backbone. Our BOLT consists of two networks, namely online and
target branches, for self-supervised representation learning. Concretely, the
online network is trained to predict the target network representation of the
same patch embedding tokens with a different perturbation. To maximally
excavate the impact of Transformer from limited medical data, we propose an
auxiliary difficulty ranking task. The Transformer is enforced to identify
which branch (i.e., online/target) is processing the more difficult perturbed
tokens. Overall, the Transformer endeavours itself to distill the
transformation-invariant features from the perturbed tokens to simultaneously
achieve difficulty measurement and maintain the consistency of self-supervised
representations. The proposed BOLT is evaluated on three medical image
processing tasks, i.e., skin lesion classification, knee fatigue fracture
grading and diabetic retinopathy grading. The experimental results validate the
superiority of our BOLT for medical image classification, compared to ImageNet
pretrained weights and state-of-the-art self-supervised learning approaches.",2023-01-03,2023,2023-01,medical
"Artificial Intelligence Model for Tumoral Clinical Decision Support
  Systems","Comparative diagnostic in brain tumor evaluation makes possible to use the
available information of a medical center to compare similar cases when a new
patient is evaluated. By leveraging Artificial Intelligence models, the
proposed system is able of retrieving the most similar cases of brain tumors

by generating more accurate representations of medical images, with a
particular focus on patient-specific normal features and pathologies. The
proposed model uses Artificial Intelligence to detect patient features to
recommend the most similar cases from a database. The system not only suggests
similar cases but also balances the representation of healthy and abnormal
features in its design. This not only encourages the generalization of its use
but also aids clinicians in their decision-making processes. We conducted a
comparative analysis of our approach in relation to similar studies. The
proposed architecture obtains a Dice coefficient of 0.474 in both tumoral and
healthy regions of the patients, which outperforms previous literature. Our
proposed model excels at extracting and combining anatomical and pathological
features from brain \glspl{mr}, achieving state-of-the-art results while
relying on less expensive label information. This substantially reduces the
overall cost of the training process. This paper provides substantial grounds
for further exploration of the broader applicability and optimization of the
proposed architecture to enhance clinical decision-making. The novel approach
presented in this work marks a significant advancement in the field of medical

deep network collaboratively without sharing their raw medical data. In order

a group of class vectors is obtained in an ensemble rather than the weighted
average method on the server. The major classifier vectors are then distributed
to all clients and the local training of each client is Contrasted with Major
Classifier vectors (FedCMC), so the local model is not prone to overfitting to
the local label distribution. FedCMC requires only a small amount of additional
transfer of classifier parameters without any leakage of raw data, extracted

the predictions are either correct or incorrect, predictions in medical image
segmentation may be partially correct and incorrect simultaneously. In this
paper, we explore this expressiveness to extract the useful properties of these
systems and formally define a novel multi-modal evaluation (MME) approach to

"Decision Support System for Chronic Diseases Based on Drug-Drug
  Interactions","Many patients with chronic diseases resort to multiple medications to relieve
various symptoms, which raises concerns about the safety of multiple medication
use, as severe drug-drug antagonism can lead to serious adverse effects or even
death. This paper presents a Decision Support System, called DSSDDI, based on
drug-drug interactions to support doctors prescribing decisions. DSSDDI
contains three modules, Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) module, Medical Decision
(MD) module and Medical Support (MS) module. The DDI module learns safer and
more effective drug representations from the drug-drug interactions. To capture
the potential causal relationship between DDI and medication use, the MD module
considers the representations of patients and drugs as context, DDI and
patients' similarity as treatment, and medication use as outcome to construct
counterfactual links for the representation learning. Furthermore, the MS
module provides drug candidates to doctors with explanations. Experiments on
the chronic data collected from the Hong Kong Chronic Disease Study Project and
a public diagnostic data MIMIC-III demonstrate that DSSDDI can be a reliable
reference for doctors in terms of safety and efficiency of clinical diagnosis,
with significant improvements compared to baseline methods.",2023-03-04,2023,2023-03,medical
A Comparison of Methods for Neural Network Aggregation,"Deep learning has been successful in the theoretical aspect. For deep
learning to succeed in industry, we need to have algorithms capable of handling
many inconsistencies appearing in real data. These inconsistencies can have
large effects on the implementation of a deep learning algorithm. Artificial
Intelligence is currently changing the medical industry. However, receiving
authorization to use medical data for training machine learning algorithms is a
huge hurdle. A possible solution is sharing the data without sharing the
patient information. We propose a multi-party computation protocol for the deep
learning algorithm. The protocol enables to conserve both the privacy and the
security of the training data. Three approaches of neural networks assembly are
analyzed: transfer learning, average ensemble learning, and series network
learning. The results are compared to approaches based on data-sharing in
different experiments. We analyze the security issues of the proposed protocol.
Although the analysis is based on medical data, the results of multi-party
computation of machine learning training are theoretical and can be implemented
in multiple research areas.",2023-03-06,2023,2023-03,medical
"Cybersecurity of AI medical devices: risks, legislation, and challenges","Medical devices and artificial intelligence systems rapidly transform
healthcare provisions. At the same time, due to their nature, AI in or as
medical devices might get exposed to cyberattacks, leading to patient safety
and security risks. This book chapter is divided into three parts. The first
part starts by setting the scene where we explain the role of cybersecurity in
healthcare. Then, we briefly define what we refer to when we talk about AI that
is considered a medical device by itself or supports one. To illustrate the
risks such medical devices pose, we provide three examples: the poisoning of
datasets, social engineering, and data or source code extraction. In the second
part, the paper provides an overview of the European Union's regulatory
framework relevant for ensuring the cybersecurity of AI as or in medical
devices (MDR, NIS Directive, Cybersecurity Act, GDPR, the AI Act proposal and
the NIS 2 Directive proposal). Finally, the third part of the paper examines
possible challenges stemming from the EU regulatory framework. In particular,
we look toward the challenges deriving from the two legislative proposals and
their interaction with the existing legislation concerning AI medical devices'
cybersecurity. They are structured as answers to the following questions: (1)
how will the AI Act interact with the MDR regarding the cybersecurity and
safety requirements?; (2) how should we interpret incident notification
requirements from the NIS 2 Directive proposal and MDR?; and (3) what are the
consequences of the evolving term of critical infrastructures?

Multimodal Information Fusion For The Diagnosis Of Diabetic Retinopathy,"Diabetes is a chronic disease characterized by excess sugar in the blood and
affects 422 million people worldwide, including 3.3 million in France. One of
the frequent complications of diabetes is diabetic retinopathy (DR): it is the
leading cause of blindness in the working population of developed countries. As
a result, ophthalmology is on the verge of a revolution in screening,
diagnosing, and managing of pathologies. This upheaval is led by the arrival of

"How can Deep Learning Retrieve the Write-Missing Additional Diagnosis
  from Chinese Electronic Medical Record For DRG","The purpose of write-missing diagnosis detection is to find diseases that
have been clearly diagnosed from medical records but are missed in the
discharge diagnosis. Unlike the definition of missed diagnosis, the
write-missing diagnosis is clearly manifested in the medical record without
further reasoning. The write-missing diagnosis is a common problem, often
caused by physician negligence. The write-missing diagnosis will result in an
incomplete diagnosis of medical records. While under DRG grouping, the
write-missing diagnoses will miss important additional diagnoses (CC, MCC),
thus affecting the correct rate of DRG enrollment.
  Under the circumstance that countries generally start to adopt DRG enrollment
and payment, the problem of write-missing diagnosis is a common and serious
problem. The current manual-based method is expensive due to the complex
content of the full medical record. We think this problem is suitable to be
solved as natural language processing. But to the best of our knowledge, no
researchers have conducted research on this problem based on natural language
processing methods.
  We propose a framework for solving the problem of write-missing diagnosis,
which mainly includes three modules: disease recall module, disease context
logic judgment module, and disease relationship comparison module. Through this
framework, we verify that the problem of write-missing diagnosis can be solved
well, and the results are interpretable. At the same time, we propose advanced
solutions for the disease context logic judgment module and disease
relationship comparison module, which have obvious advantages compared with the
mainstream methods of the same type of problems. Finally, we verified the value

Q2ATransformer: Improving Medical VQA via an Answer Querying Decoder,"Medical Visual Question Answering (VQA) systems play a supporting role to
understand clinic-relevant information carried by medical images. The questions
to a medical image include two categories: close-end (such as Yes/No question)
and open-end. To obtain answers, the majority of the existing medical VQA
methods relies on classification approaches, while a few works attempt to use
generation approaches or a mixture of the two. The classification approaches
are relatively simple but perform poorly on long open-end questions. To bridge
this gap, in this paper, we propose a new Transformer based framework for
medical VQA (named as Q2ATransformer), which integrates the advantages of both
the classification and the generation approaches and provides a unified
treatment for the close-end and open-end questions. Specifically, we introduce
an additional Transformer decoder with a set of learnable candidate answer
embeddings to query the existence of each answer class to a given
image-question pair. Through the Transformer attention, the candidate answer
embeddings interact with the fused features of the image-question pair to make
the decision. In this way, despite being a classification-based approach, our
method provides a mechanism to interact with the answer information for
prediction like the generation-based approaches. On the other hand, by
classification, we mitigate the task difficulty by reducing the search space of
answers. Our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on two medical
VQA benchmarks. Especially, for the open-end questions, we achieve 79.19% on
VQA-RAD and 54.85% on PathVQA, with 16.09% and 41.45% absolute improvements,

"ACTION++: Improving Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation with
  Adaptive Anatomical Contrast","Medical data often exhibits long-tail distributions with heavy class
imbalance, which naturally leads to difficulty in classifying the minority
classes (i.e., boundary regions or rare objects). Recent work has significantly
improved semi-supervised medical image segmentation in long-tailed scenarios by
equipping them with unsupervised contrastive criteria. However, it remains
unclear how well they will perform in the labeled portion of data where class
distribution is also highly imbalanced. In this work, we present ACTION++, an
improved contrastive learning framework with adaptive anatomical contrast for
semi-supervised medical segmentation. Specifically, we propose an adaptive
supervised contrastive loss, where we first compute the optimal locations of
class centers uniformly distributed on the embedding space (i.e., off-line),
and then perform online contrastive matching training by encouraging different
class features to adaptively match these distinct and uniformly distributed
class centers. Moreover, we argue that blindly adopting a constant temperature
$\tau$ in the contrastive loss on long-tailed medical data is not optimal, and
propose to use a dynamic $\tau$ via a simple cosine schedule to yield better
separation between majority and minority classes. Empirically, we evaluate
ACTION++ on ACDC and LA benchmarks and show that it achieves state-of-the-art
across two semi-supervised settings. Theoretically, we analyze the performance
of adaptive anatomical contrast and confirm its superiority in label
efficiency.",2023-04-05,2023,2023-04,medical
"Implicit Anatomical Rendering for Medical Image Segmentation with
  Stochastic Experts","Integrating high-level semantically correlated contents and low-level
anatomical features is of central importance in medical image segmentation.
Towards this end, recent deep learning-based medical segmentation methods have
shown great promise in better modeling such information. However, convolution
operators for medical segmentation typically operate on regular grids, which
inherently blur the high-frequency regions, i.e., boundary regions. In this
work, we propose MORSE, a generic implicit neural rendering framework designed
at an anatomical level to assist learning in medical image segmentation. Our
method is motivated by the fact that implicit neural representation has been
shown to be more effective in fitting complex signals and solving computer
graphics problems than discrete grid-based representation. The core of our
approach is to formulate medical image segmentation as a rendering problem in
an end-to-end manner. Specifically, we continuously align the coarse
segmentation prediction with the ambiguous coordinate-based point
representations and aggregate these features to adaptively refine the boundary
region. To parallelly optimize multi-scale pixel-level features, we leverage
the idea from Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) to design and train our MORSE with a
stochastic gating mechanism. Our experiments demonstrate that MORSE can work
well with different medical segmentation backbones, consistently achieving
competitive performance improvements in both 2D and 3D supervised medical
segmentation methods. We also theoretically analyze the superiority of MORSE.",2023-04-06,2023,2023-04,medical

medical image segmentation tasks, we explore -- 1) the replaceable nature of
Transformer-learnt representations, 2) Transformer capacity alone cannot
prevent representational replaceability and works in tandem with effective

"BerDiff: Conditional Bernoulli Diffusion Model for Medical Image
  Segmentation","Medical image segmentation is a challenging task with inherent ambiguity and
high uncertainty, attributed to factors such as unclear tumor boundaries and
multiple plausible annotations. The accuracy and diversity of segmentation
masks are both crucial for providing valuable references to radiologists in
clinical practice. While existing diffusion models have shown strong capacities
in various visual generation tasks, it is still challenging to deal with
discrete masks in segmentation. To achieve accurate and diverse medical image
segmentation masks, we propose a novel conditional Bernoulli Diffusion model
for medical image segmentation (BerDiff). Instead of using the Gaussian noise,
we first propose to use the Bernoulli noise as the diffusion kernel to enhance
the capacity of the diffusion model for binary segmentation tasks, resulting in
more accurate segmentation masks. Second, by leveraging the stochastic nature
of the diffusion model, our BerDiff randomly samples the initial Bernoulli
noise and intermediate latent variables multiple times to produce a range of
diverse segmentation masks, which can highlight salient regions of interest
that can serve as valuable references for radiologists. In addition, our
BerDiff can efficiently sample sub-sequences from the overall trajectory of the
reverse diffusion, thereby speeding up the segmentation process. Extensive
experimental results on two medical image segmentation datasets with different

Medical Question Summarization with Entity-driven Contrastive Learning,"By summarizing longer consumer health questions into shorter and essential
ones, medical question answering (MQA) systems can more accurately understand
consumer intentions and retrieve suitable answers. However, medical question
summarization is very challenging due to obvious distinctions in health trouble
descriptions from patients and doctors. Although existing works have attempted
to utilize Seq2Seq, reinforcement learning, or contrastive learning to solve
the problem, two challenges remain: how to correctly capture question focus to
model its semantic intention, and how to obtain reliable datasets to fairly
evaluate performance. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel
medical question summarization framework using entity-driven contrastive
learning (ECL). ECL employs medical entities in frequently asked questions
(FAQs) as focuses and devises an effective mechanism to generate hard negative
samples. This approach forces models to pay attention to the crucial focus
information and generate more ideal question summarization. Additionally, we
find that some MQA datasets suffer from serious data leakage problems, such as
the iCliniq dataset's 33% duplicate rate. To evaluate the related methods
fairly, this paper carefully checks leaked samples to reorganize more

Segment Anything Model for Medical Image Analysis: an Experimental Study,"Training segmentation models for medical images continues to be challenging

impressive, medical image domains pose their own set of challenges. Here, we
perform an extensive evaluation of SAM's ability to segment medical images on a
collection of 19 medical imaging datasets from various modalities and
anatomies. We report the following findings: (1) SAM's performance based on
single prompts highly varies depending on the dataset and the task, from
IoU=0.1135 for spine MRI to IoU=0.8650 for hip X-ray. (2) Segmentation
performance appears to be better for well-circumscribed objects with prompts
with less ambiguity and poorer in various other scenarios such as the
segmentation of brain tumors. (3) SAM performs notably better with box prompts
than with point prompts. (4) SAM outperforms similar methods RITM, SimpleClick,
and FocalClick in almost all single-point prompt settings. (5) When
multiple-point prompts are provided iteratively, SAM's performance generally
improves only slightly while other methods' performance improves to the level
that surpasses SAM's point-based performance. We also provide several
illustrations for SAM's performance on all tested datasets, iterative
segmentation, and SAM's behavior given prompt ambiguity. We conclude that SAM
shows impressive zero-shot segmentation performance for certain medical imaging
datasets, but moderate to poor performance for others. SAM has the potential to
make a significant impact in automated medical image segmentation in medical

"Input Augmentation with SAM: Boosting Medical Image Segmentation with

general-purpose segmentation for computer vision tasks. SAM was trained using
11 million images with over 1 billion masks and can produce segmentation
results for a wide range of objects in natural scene images. SAM can be viewed
as a general perception model for segmentation (partitioning images into
semantically meaningful regions). Thus, how to utilize such a large foundation
model for medical image segmentation is an emerging research target. This paper
shows that although SAM does not immediately give high-quality segmentation for
medical image data, its generated masks, features, and stability scores are
useful for building and training better medical image segmentation models. In
particular, we demonstrate how to use SAM to augment image input for
commonly-used medical image segmentation models (e.g., U-Net). Experiments on

  Objective: This research is among the first studies on responsible and
ethical AIGC (Artificial Intelligence Generated Content) in medicine. We focus
on analyzing the differences between medical texts written by human experts and

the linguistic features of these two types of content and uncover differences
in vocabulary, part-of-speech, dependency, sentiment, perplexity, etc. Finally,
we design and implement machine learning methods to detect medical text

  Results: Medical texts written by humans are more concrete, more diverse, and
typically contain more useful information, while medical texts generated by
ChatGPT pay more attention to fluency and logic, and usually express general
terminologies rather than effective information specific to the context of the

"Towards Medical Artificial General Intelligence via Knowledge-Enhanced
  Multimodal Pretraining","Medical artificial general intelligence (MAGI) enables one foundation model
to solve different medical tasks, which is very practical in the medical
domain. It can significantly reduce the requirement of large amounts of
task-specific data by sufficiently sharing medical knowledge among different
tasks. However, due to the challenges of designing strongly generalizable
models with limited and complex medical data, most existing approaches tend to
develop task-specific models. To take a step towards MAGI, we propose a new
paradigm called Medical-knOwledge-enhanced mulTimOdal pretRaining (MOTOR). In
MOTOR, we combine two kinds of basic medical knowledge, i.e., general and
specific knowledge, in a complementary manner to boost the general pretraining
process. As a result, the foundation model with comprehensive basic knowledge
can learn compact representations from pretraining radiographic data for better
cross-modal alignment. MOTOR unifies the understanding and generation, which
are two kinds of core intelligence of an AI system, into a single medical
foundation model, to flexibly handle more diverse medical tasks. To enable a
comprehensive evaluation and facilitate further research, we construct a
medical multimodal benchmark including a wide range of downstream tasks, such
as chest x-ray report generation and medical visual question answering.
Extensive experiments on our benchmark show that MOTOR obtains promising
results through simple task-oriented adaptation. The visualization shows that
the injected knowledge successfully highlights key information in the medical
data, demonstrating the excellent interpretability of MOTOR. Our MOTOR

"Zero-shot performance of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in 2D medical
  imaging: A comprehensive evaluation and practical guidelines","Segmentation in medical imaging is a critical component for the diagnosis,
monitoring, and treatment of various diseases and medical conditions.
Presently, the medical segmentation landscape is dominated by numerous
specialized deep learning models, each fine-tuned for specific segmentation
tasks and image modalities. The recently-introduced Segment Anything Model
(SAM) employs the ViT neural architecture and harnesses a massive training
dataset to segment nearly any object; however, its suitability to the medical
domain has not yet been investigated. In this study, we explore the zero-shot
performance of SAM in medical imaging by implementing eight distinct prompt
strategies across six datasets from four imaging modalities, including X-ray,
ultrasound, dermatoscopy, and colonoscopy. Our findings reveal that SAM's
zero-shot performance is not only comparable to, but in certain cases,
surpasses the current state-of-the-art. Based on these results, we propose
practical guidelines that require minimal interaction while consistently
yielding robust outcomes across all assessed contexts. The source code, along
with a demonstration of the recommended guidelines, can be accessed at

"DIAMANT: Dual Image-Attention Map Encoders For Medical Image
  Segmentation","Although purely transformer-based architectures showed promising performance
in many computer vision tasks, many hybrid models consisting of CNN and
transformer blocks are introduced to fit more specialized tasks. Nevertheless,
despite the performance gain of both pure and hybrid transformer-based
architectures compared to CNNs in medical imaging segmentation, their high
training cost and complexity make it challenging to use them in real scenarios.
In this work, we propose simple architectures based on purely convolutional
layers, and show that by just taking advantage of the attention map
visualizations obtained from a self-supervised pretrained vision transformer
network (e.g., DINO) one can outperform complex transformer-based networks with
much less computation costs. The proposed architecture is composed of two
encoder branches with the original image as input in one branch and the
attention map visualizations of the same image from multiple self-attention
heads from a pre-trained DINO model (as multiple channels) in the other branch.
The results of our experiments on two publicly available medical imaging

SCOPE: Structural Continuity Preservation for Medical Image Segmentation,"Although the preservation of shape continuity and physiological anatomy is a
natural assumption in the segmentation of medical images, it is often neglected
by deep learning methods that mostly aim for the statistical modeling of input
data as pixels rather than interconnected structures. In biological structures,
however, organs are not separate entities; for example, in reality, a severed
vessel is an indication of an underlying problem, but traditional segmentation
models are not designed to strictly enforce the continuity of anatomy,
potentially leading to inaccurate medical diagnoses. To address this issue, we
propose a graph-based approach that enforces the continuity and connectivity of
anatomical topology in medical images. Our method encodes the continuity of
shapes as a graph constraint, ensuring that the network's predictions maintain
this continuity. We evaluate our method on two public benchmarks on retinal
vessel segmentation, showing significant improvements in connectivity metrics
compared to traditional methods while getting better or on-par performance on
segmentation metrics.",2023-04-28,2023,2023-04,medical
SAM on Medical Images: A Comprehensive Study on Three Prompt Modes,"The Segment Anything Model (SAM) made an eye-catching debut recently and
inspired many researchers to explore its potential and limitation in terms of
zero-shot generalization capability. As the first promptable foundation model
for segmentation tasks, it was trained on a large dataset with an unprecedented
number of images and annotations. This large-scale dataset and its promptable
nature endow the model with strong zero-shot generalization. Although the SAM
has shown competitive performance on several datasets, we still want to
investigate its zero-shot generalization on medical images. As we know, the
acquisition of medical image annotation usually requires a lot of effort from
professional practitioners. Therefore, if there exists a foundation model that
can give high-quality mask prediction simply based on a few point prompts, this
model will undoubtedly become the game changer for medical image analysis. To
evaluate whether SAM has the potential to become the foundation model for
medical image segmentation tasks, we collected more than 12 public medical
image datasets that cover various organs and modalities. We also explore what
kind of prompt can lead to the best zero-shot performance with different
modalities. Furthermore, we find that a pattern shows that the perturbation of
the box size will significantly change the prediction accuracy. Finally,
Extensive experiments show that the predicted mask quality varied a lot among
different datasets. And providing proper prompts, such as bounding boxes, to
the SAM will significantly increase its performance.",2023-04-28,2023,2023-04,medical

  multi-stage approach using large language models","A medical provider's summary of a patient visit serves several critical
purposes, including clinical decision-making, facilitating hand-offs between
providers, and as a reference for the patient. An effective summary is required

inaccuracies in visit summaries (for example, summarizing ""patient does not

care for the patient.
  This paper tackles the problem of medical conversation summarization by
discretizing the task into several smaller dialogue-understanding tasks that

affirmations within the conversation to serve as building blocks. We study
dynamically constructing few-shot prompts for tasks by conditioning on relevant
patient information and use GPT-3 as the backbone for our experiments. We also
develop GPT-derived summarization metrics to measure performance against
reference summaries quantitatively. Both our human evaluation study and metrics

stems from the complexity of integrating diverse syntax and semantics,
language-specific medical terminology, and culture-specific implicit knowledge.
Therefore, one crucial aspect to consider is the presence of community bias

Unifying Cross-Lingual Medical Vision-Language Pre-Training (Med-UniC),
designed to integrate multimodal medical data from the two most prevalent
languages, English and Spanish. Specifically, we propose Cross-lingual Text
Alignment Regularization (CTR) to explicitly unify cross-lingual semantic

rendering our optimization objective to not depend on negative samples, thereby
significantly mitigating the bias from determining positive-negative sample
pairs within analogous medical reports. Furthermore, it ensures that the
cross-lingual representation is not biased toward any specific language
community. Med-UniC reaches superior performance across 5 medical image tasks

vision-language (VL) datasets such as MSCOCO, vision-language pre-training

various VL tasks such as visual-question answering. However, studies on VLP in
the medical domain have so far been scanty. To provide a comprehensive
perspective on VLP for medical VL tasks, we conduct a thorough experimental
analysis to study key factors that may affect the performance of VLP with a
unified vision-language Transformer. To allow making sound and quick
pre-training decisions, we propose RadioGraphy Captions (RGC), a high-quality,
multi-modality radiographic dataset containing 18,434 image-caption pairs
collected from an open-access online database MedPix. RGC can be used as a
pre-training dataset or a new benchmark for medical report generation and

"Preserving privacy in domain transfer of medical AI models comes at no
  performance costs: The integral role of differential privacy","Developing robust and effective artificial intelligence (AI) models in
medicine requires access to large amounts of patient data. The use of AI models
solely trained on large multi-institutional datasets can help with this, yet
the imperative to ensure data privacy remains, particularly as membership
inference risks breaching patient confidentiality. As a proposed remedy, we
advocate for the integration of differential privacy (DP). We specifically
investigate the performance of models trained with DP as compared to models
trained without DP on data from institutions that the model had not seen during
its training (i.e., external validation) - the situation that is reflective of
the clinical use of AI models. By leveraging more than 590,000 chest
radiographs from five institutions, we evaluated the efficacy of DP-enhanced
domain transfer (DP-DT) in diagnosing cardiomegaly, pleural effusion,
pneumonia, atelectasis, and in identifying healthy subjects. We juxtaposed
DP-DT with non-DP-DT and examined diagnostic accuracy and demographic fairness
using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) as the
main metric, as well as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Our results
show that DP-DT, even with exceptionally high privacy levels (epsilon around
1), performs comparably to non-DP-DT (P>0.119 across all domains). Furthermore,
DP-DT led to marginal AUC differences - less than 1% - for nearly all
subgroups, relative to non-DP-DT. Despite consistent evidence suggesting that
DP models induce significant performance degradation for on-domain
applications, we show that off-domain performance is almost not affected.
Therefore, we ardently advocate for the adoption of DP in training diagnostic
medical AI models, given its minimal impact on performance.",2023-06-10,2023,2023-06,medical

"Temporally-Extended Prompts Optimization for SAM in Interactive Medical
  Image Segmentation","The Segmentation Anything Model (SAM) has recently emerged as a foundation
model for addressing image segmentation. Owing to the intrinsic complexity of
medical images and the high annotation cost, the medical image segmentation
(MIS) community has been encouraged to investigate SAM's zero-shot capabilities
to facilitate automatic annotation. Inspired by the extraordinary
accomplishments of interactive medical image segmentation (IMIS) paradigm, this
paper focuses on assessing the potential of SAM's zero-shot capabilities within
the IMIS paradigm to amplify its benefits in the MIS domain. Regrettably, we
observe that SAM's vulnerability to prompt forms (e.g., points, bounding boxes)
becomes notably pronounced in IMIS. This leads us to develop a framework that
adaptively offers suitable prompt forms for human experts. We refer to the
framework above as temporally-extended prompts optimization (TEPO) and model it
as a Markov decision process, solvable through reinforcement learning.
Numerical experiments on the standardized benchmark BraTS2020 demonstrate that
the learned TEPO agent can further enhance SAM's zero-shot capability in the
MIS context.",2023-06-15,2023,2023-06,medical
"Path to Medical AGI: Unify Domain-specific Medical LLMs with the Lowest
  Cost","Medical artificial general intelligence (AGI) is an emerging field that aims
to develop systems specifically designed for medical applications that possess
the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of
tasks and domains. Large language models (LLMs) represent a significant step
towards AGI. However, training cross-domain LLMs in the medical field poses
significant challenges primarily attributed to the requirement of collecting
data from diverse domains. This task becomes particularly difficult due to
privacy restrictions and the scarcity of publicly available medical datasets.
Here, we propose Medical AGI (MedAGI), a paradigm to unify domain-specific
medical LLMs with the lowest cost, and suggest a possible path to achieve
medical AGI. With an increasing number of domain-specific professional
multimodal LLMs in the medical field being developed, MedAGI is designed to
automatically select appropriate medical models by analyzing users' questions
with our novel adaptive expert selection algorithm. It offers a unified
approach to existing LLMs in the medical field, eliminating the need for
retraining regardless of the introduction of new models. This characteristic
renders it a future-proof solution in the dynamically advancing medical domain.
To showcase the resilience of MedAGI, we conducted an evaluation across three
distinct medical domains: dermatology diagnosis, X-ray diagnosis, and analysis
of pathology pictures. The results demonstrated that MedAGI exhibited
remarkable versatility and scalability, delivering exceptional performance
across diverse domains. Our code is publicly available to facilitate further

medical settings. Motivated by the recent work on separable group convolutions,
we devise a SE(3) group convolution kernel separated into a continuous SO(3)
(rotation) kernel and a spatial kernel. We approximate equivariance to the
continuous setting by sampling uniform SO(3) grids. Our continuous SO(3) kernel
is parameterized via RBF interpolation on similarly uniform grids. We
demonstrate the advantages of our approach in volumetric medical image

representation learning for semi-supervised learning, by developing a novel
Multi-Scale Cross Supervised Contrastive Learning (MCSC) framework, to segment
structures in medical images. We jointly train CNN and Transformer models,
regularising their features to be semantically consistent across different
scales. Our approach contrasts multi-scale features based on ground-truth and
cross-predicted labels, in order to extract robust feature representations that
reflect intra- and inter-slice relationships across the whole dataset. To
tackle class imbalance, we take into account the prevalence of each class to
guide contrastive learning and ensure that features adequately capture
infrequent classes. Extensive experiments on two multi-structure medical
segmentation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MCSC. It not only
outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods by more than 3.0% in Dice,

attention due to its natural merit on privacy protection. However, when
heterogenous medical data exists between different hospitals, federated
learning usually has to face with degradation of performance. In the paper, we
propose a new personalized framework of federated learning to handle the

Is attention all you need in medical image analysis? A review,"Medical imaging is a key component in clinical diagnosis, treatment planning

CNNs achieved performance gains in medical image analysis (MIA) over the last
years. CNNs can efficiently model local pixel interactions and be trained on
small-scale MI data. The main disadvantage of typical CNN models is that they
ignore global pixel relationships within images, which limits their
generalisation ability to understand out-of-distribution data with different
'global' information. The recent progress of Artificial Intelligence gave rise
to Transformers, which can learn global relationships from data. However, full
Transformer models need to be trained on large-scale data and involve
tremendous computational complexity. Attention and Transformer compartments

Med-HALT: Medical Domain Hallucination Test for Large Language Models,"This research paper focuses on the challenges posed by hallucinations in
large language models (LLMs), particularly in the context of the medical
domain. Hallucination, wherein these models generate plausible yet unverified

applications. We propose a new benchmark and dataset, Med-HALT (Medical Domain
Hallucination Test), designed specifically to evaluate and reduce
hallucinations. Med-HALT provides a diverse multinational dataset derived from
medical examinations across various countries and includes multiple innovative
testing modalities. Med-HALT includes two categories of tests reasoning and
memory-based hallucination tests, designed to assess LLMs's problem-solving and
information retrieval abilities.
  Our study evaluated leading LLMs, including Text Davinci, GPT-3.5, LlaMa-2,
MPT, and Falcon, revealing significant differences in their performance. The

principles to guide the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies on
future battlefields. Despite stark differences, there are core similarities
between the military and medical service. Warriors on battlefields often face
life-altering circumstances that require quick decision-making. Medical
providers experience similar challenges in a rapidly changing healthcare
environment, such as in the emergency department or during surgery treating a
life-threatening condition. Generative AI, an emerging technology designed to
efficiently generate valuable information, holds great promise. As computing
power becomes more accessible and the abundance of health data, such as
electronic health records, electrocardiograms, and medical images, increases,
it is inevitable that healthcare will be revolutionized by this technology.
Recently, generative AI has captivated the research community, leading to
debates about its application in healthcare, mainly due to concerns about
transparency and related issues. Meanwhile, concerns about the potential
exacerbation of health disparities due to modeling biases have raised notable
ethical concerns regarding the use of this technology in healthcare. However,
the ethical principles for generative AI in healthcare have been understudied,
and decision-makers often fail to consider the significance of generative AI.
In this paper, we propose GREAT PLEA ethical principles, encompassing

"Rapid Training Data Creation by Synthesizing Medical Images for
  Classification and Localization","While the use of artificial intelligence (AI) for medical image analysis is
gaining wide acceptance, the expertise, time and cost required to generate
annotated data in the medical field are significantly high, due to limited
availability of both data and expert annotation. Strongly supervised object
localization models require data that is exhaustively annotated, meaning all
objects of interest in an image are identified. This is difficult to achieve
and verify for medical images. We present a method for the transformation of
real data to train any Deep Neural Network to solve the above problems. We show
the efficacy of this approach on both a weakly supervised localization model
and a strongly supervised localization model. For the weakly supervised model,
we show that the localization accuracy increases significantly using the
generated data. For the strongly supervised model, this approach overcomes the
need for exhaustive annotation on real images. In the latter model, we show
that the accuracy, when trained with generated images, closely parallels the

  Vision-Language Models","Medical image segmentation allows quantifying target structure size and
shape, aiding in disease diagnosis, prognosis, surgery planning, and
comprehension.Building upon recent advancements in foundation Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) from natural image-text pairs, several studies have proposed
adapting them to Vision-Language Segmentation Models (VLSMs) that allow using
language text as an additional input to segmentation models. Introducing
auxiliary information via text with human-in-the-loop prompting during
inference opens up unique opportunities, such as open vocabulary segmentation
and potentially more robust segmentation models against out-of-distribution
data. Although transfer learning from natural to medical images has been
explored for image-only segmentation models, the joint representation of
vision-language in segmentation problems remains underexplored. This study
introduces the first systematic study on transferring VLSMs to 2D medical
images, using carefully curated $11$ datasets encompassing diverse modalities
and insightful language prompts and experiments. Our findings demonstrate that
although VLSMs show competitive performance compared to image-only models for
segmentation after finetuning in limited medical image datasets, not all VLSMs
utilize the additional information from language prompts, with image features
playing a dominant role. While VLSMs exhibit enhanced performance in handling
pooled datasets with diverse modalities and show potential robustness to domain
shifts compared to conventional segmentation models, our results suggest that
novel approaches are required to enable VLSMs to leverage the various auxiliary

False Negative/Positive Control for SAM on Noisy Medical Images,"The Segment Anything Model (SAM) is a recently developed all-range foundation
model for image segmentation. It can use sparse manual prompts such as bounding

false-positive (FP) correction (FNPC) strategy. We evaluate the method on two
ultrasound datasets and show improvement in SAM's performance and robustness to
inaccurate prompts, without the necessity for further training or tuning.
Moreover, we present the Single-Slice-to-Volume (SS2V) method, enabling 3D

necessitating both localized and holistic semantic understanding to accurately
delineate areas of interest, such as critical tissues or aberrant features.
This complexity is heightened in medical image segmentation due to the high
degree of inter-class similarities, intra-class variations, and possible image
obfuscation. The segmentation task further diversifies when considering the
study of histopathology slides for autoimmune diseases like dermatomyositis.
The analysis of cell inflammation and interaction in these cases has been less

"Exploration of the Rashomon Set Assists Trustworthy Explanations for
  Medical Data","The machine learning modeling process conventionally culminates in selecting
a single model that maximizes a selected performance metric. However, this
approach leads to abandoning a more profound analysis of slightly inferior

extends beyond predictions to valuable insight generation, relying solely on a
single model can result in misleading or incomplete conclusions. This problem
is particularly pertinent when dealing with a set of models known as
$\textit{Rashomon set}$, with performance close to maximum one. Such a set can
be numerous and may contain models describing the data in a different way,
which calls for comprehensive analysis. This paper introduces a novel process

approach, we showcase its application in predicting survival among
hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) patients - a foundational case study.
Additionally, we benchmark our approach on other medical data sets,

AutoProSAM: Automated Prompting SAM for 3D Multi-Organ Segmentation,"Segment Anything Model (SAM) is one of the pioneering prompt-based foundation
models for image segmentation and has been rapidly adopted for various medical
imaging applications. However, in clinical settings, creating effective prompts
is notably challenging and time-consuming, requiring the expertise of domain

primary advantage, its interactive capability with end users, in medical
applications. Moreover, recent studies have indicated that SAM, originally
designed for 2D natural images, performs suboptimally on 3D medical image

Based on this relevance, we design two graph structures to express medication
safety and precision at the same level to obtain patient representations.
Finally, the patient's historical clinical information is fitted to generate
medication combinations for the current health condition. We employed the

A Systematic Review of Few-Shot Learning in Medical Imaging,"The lack of annotated medical images limits the performance of deep learning
models, which usually need large-scale labelled datasets. Few-shot learning
techniques can reduce data scarcity issues and enhance medical image analysis,
especially with meta-learning. This systematic review gives a comprehensive
overview of few-shot learning in medical imaging. We searched the literature
systematically and selected 80 relevant articles published from 2018 to 2023.
We clustered the articles based on medical outcomes, such as tumour
segmentation, disease classification, and image registration; anatomical
structure investigated (i.e. heart, lung, etc.); and the meta-learning method
used. For each cluster, we examined the papers' distributions and the results
provided by the state-of-the-art. In addition, we identified a generic pipeline
shared among all the studies. The review shows that few-shot learning can
overcome data scarcity in most outcomes and that meta-learning is a popular
choice to perform few-shot learning because it can adapt to new tasks with few
labelled samples. In addition, following meta-learning, supervised learning and
semi-supervised learning stand out as the predominant techniques employed to
tackle few-shot learning challenges in medical imaging and also best

presents a novel Can-SAVE cancer risk assessment method combining a survival
analysis approach with a gradient-boosting algorithm. It is highly accessible
and resource-efficient, utilizing only a sequence of high-level medical events.
We tested the proposed method in a long-term retrospective experiment covering
more than 1.1 million people and four regions of Russia. The Can-SAVE method
significantly exceeds the baselines by the Average Precision metric of
22.8%$\pm$2.7% vs 15.1%$\pm$2.6%. The extensive ablation study also confirmed
the proposed method's dominant performance. The experiment supervised by
oncologists shows a reliable cancer patient detection rate of up to 84 out of
1000 selected. Such results surpass the medical screening strategies estimates;
the typical age-specific Number Needed to Screen is only 9 out of 1000 (for

outputs. Three evaluation ways including quantitative analysis, human
evaluation, and case study are employed to achieve an in-depth and extensive
evaluation. Our evaluation shows that GPT-4V excels in understanding medical
images and is able to generate high-quality radiology reports and effectively
answer questions about medical images. Meanwhile, it is found that its
performance for medical visual grounding needs to be substantially improved. In
addition, we observe the discrepancy between the evaluation outcome from
quantitative analysis and that from human evaluation. This discrepancy suggests
the limitations of conventional metrics in assessing the performance of large

"Continuous Training and Fine-tuning for Domain-Specific Language Models
  in Medical Question Answering","Large language models exhibit promising general capabilities but often lack
specialized knowledge for domain-specific tasks. Developing domain experts from
a base model enables a range of applications without prohibitive training
costs. This work demonstrates a method using continuous training and
instruction fine-tuning to rapidly adapt Llama 2 base models to the Chinese
medical domain. We first conduct continuous training on 1B tokens from Chinese
medical references to teach relevant vocabulary and knowledge. The models are
then fine-tuned on 54K examples sourced from the Chinese National Medical
Licensing Examination. Experiments on Chinese medical data confirm the
effectiveness of this approach, producing a model comparable to GPT-3.5-turbo
while using way less computational resource. The resulting domain-specific
model could be useful for various Chinese medical applications. More broadly,
this provides a template for domain-specific training of large language models

"Towards objective and systematic evaluation of bias in artificial
  intelligence for medical imaging","Artificial intelligence (AI) models trained using medical images for clinical
tasks often exhibit bias in the form of disparities in performance between
subgroups. Since not all sources of biases in real-world medical imaging data
are easily identifiable, it is challenging to comprehensively assess how those
biases are encoded in models, and how capable bias mitigation methods are at
ameliorating performance disparities. In this article, we introduce a novel
analysis framework for systematically and objectively investigating the impact
of biases in medical images on AI models. We developed and tested this
framework for conducting controlled in silico trials to assess bias in medical
imaging AI using a tool for generating synthetic magnetic resonance images with
known disease effects and sources of bias. The feasibility is showcased by
using three counterfactual bias scenarios to measure the impact of simulated
bias effects on a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier and the
efficacy of three bias mitigation strategies. The analysis revealed that the
simulated biases resulted in expected subgroup performance disparities when the
CNN was trained on the synthetic datasets. Moreover, reweighing was identified
as the most successful bias mitigation strategy for this setup, and we
demonstrated how explainable AI methods can aid in investigating the
manifestation of bias in the model using this framework. Developing fair AI
models is a considerable challenge given that many and often unknown sources of
biases can be present in medical imaging datasets. In this work, we present a
novel methodology to objectively study the impact of biases and mitigation
strategies on deep learning pipelines, which can support the development of
clinical AI that is robust and responsible.",2023-11-03,2023,2023-11,medical

Our investigation reveals that current summarization models often produce
unfaithful outputs for medical input text. We then introduce FaMeSumm, a
framework to improve faithfulness by fine-tuning pre-trained language models

comprehension and reasoning. This has sparked significant interest in applying
LLMs to enhance various aspects of healthcare, ranging from medical education
to clinical decision support. However, medicine involves multifaceted data
modalities and nuanced reasoning skills, presenting challenges for integrating
LLMs. This paper provides a comprehensive review on the applications and
implications of LLMs in medicine. It begins by examining the fundamental
applications of general-purpose and specialized LLMs, demonstrating their
utilities in knowledge retrieval, research support, clinical workflow
automation, and diagnostic assistance. Recognizing the inherent multimodality
of medicine, the review then focuses on multimodal LLMs, investigating their
ability to process diverse data types like medical imaging and EHRs to augment

complex clinical reasoning, the paper explores the emerging development of
LLM-powered autonomous agents for healthcare. Furthermore, it summarizes the
evaluation methodologies for assessing LLMs' reliability and safety in medical

"Class-Incremental Continual Learning for General Purpose Healthcare
  Models","Healthcare clinics regularly encounter dynamic data that changes due to
variations in patient populations, treatment policies, medical devices, and
emerging disease patterns. Deep learning models can suffer from catastrophic
forgetting when fine-tuned in such scenarios, causing poor performance on
previously learned tasks. Continual learning allows learning on new tasks
without performance drop on previous tasks. In this work, we investigate the
performance of continual learning models on four different medical imaging
scenarios involving ten classification datasets from diverse modalities,
clinical specialties, and hospitals. We implement various continual learning
approaches and evaluate their performance in these scenarios. Our results
demonstrate that a single model can sequentially learn new tasks from different
specialties and achieve comparable performance to naive methods. These findings
indicate the feasibility of recycling or sharing models across the same or
different medical specialties, offering another step towards the development of
general-purpose medical imaging AI that can be shared across institutions.",2023-11-07,2023,2023-11,medical
Evaluating Large Language Models in Ophthalmology,"Purpose: The performance of three different large language models (LLMS)
(GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and PaLM2) in answering ophthalmology professional questions
was evaluated and compared with that of three different professional
populations (medical undergraduates, medical masters, and attending
physicians). Methods: A 100-item ophthalmology single-choice test was
administered to three different LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and PaLM2) and three
different professional levels (medical undergraduates, medical masters, and
attending physicians), respectively. The performance of LLM was comprehensively
evaluated and compared with the human group in terms of average score,
stability, and confidence. Results: Each LLM outperformed undergraduates in
general, with GPT-3.5 and PaLM2 being slightly below the master's level, while
GPT-4 showed a level comparable to that of attending physicians. In addition,
GPT-4 showed significantly higher answer stability and confidence than GPT-3.5

"Multimodal Foundation Models Exploit Text to Make Medical Image
  Predictions","Multimodal foundation models have shown compelling but conflicting
performance in medical image interpretation. However, the mechanisms by which
these models integrate and prioritize different data modalities, including
images and text, remain poorly understood. Here, using a diverse collection of
1014 multimodal medical cases, we evaluate the unimodal and multimodal image
interpretation abilities of proprietary (GPT-4, Gemini Pro 1.0) and open-source
(Llama-3.2-90B, LLaVA-Med-v1.5) multimodal foundational models with and without
the use of text descriptions. Across all models, image predictions were largely
driven by exploiting text, with accuracy increasing monotonically with the
amount of informative text. By contrast, human performance on medical image
interpretation did not improve with informative text. Exploitation of text is a
double-edged sword; we show that even mild suggestions of an incorrect
diagnosis in text diminishes image-based classification, reducing performance
dramatically in cases the model could previously answer with images alone.
Finally, we conducted a physician evaluation of model performance on long-form
medical cases, finding that the provision of images either reduced or had no
effect on model performance when text is already highly informative. Our
results suggest that multimodal AI models may be useful in medical diagnostic
reasoning but that their accuracy is largely driven, for better and worse, by
their exploitation of text.",2023-11-09,2023,2023-11,medical
"A Diagnosis and Treatment of Liver Diseases: Integrating Batch
  Processing, Rule-Based Event Detection and Explainable Artificial
  Intelligence","Liver diseases pose a significant global health burden, impacting many
individuals and having substantial economic and social consequences. Rising
liver problems are considered a fatal disease in many countries, such as Egypt
and Moldova. This study aims to develop a diagnosis and treatment model for
liver disease using Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), Patient Clinical Data (PCD)
ontology, and detection rules derived from a decision tree algorithm. For the
development of the ontology, the National Viral Hepatitis Control Program
(NVHCP) guidelines were used, which made the ontology more accurate and
reliable. The Apache Jena framework uses batch processing to detect events
based on these rules. Based on the event detected, queries can be directly
processed using SPARQL. We convert these Decision Tree (DT) and medical
guidelines-based rules into Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) to operationalize
the ontology. Using this SWRL in the ontology to predict different types of
liver disease with the help of the Pellet and Drools inference engines in
Protege Tools, a total of 615 records were taken from different liver diseases.
After inferring the rules, the result can be generated for the patient
according to the rules, and other patient-related details, along with different
precautionary suggestions, can be obtained based on these results. These rules
can make suggestions more accurate with the help of Explainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) with open API-based suggestions. When the patient has
prescribed a medical test, the model accommodates this result using optical
character recognition (OCR), and the same process applies when the patient has
prescribed a further medical suggestion according to the test report. These
models combine to form a comprehensive Decision Support System (DSS) for the
diagnosis of liver disease.",2023-11-10,2023,2023-11,medical
PEFT-MedAware: Large Language Model for Medical Awareness,"Chat models are capable of answering a wide range of questions, however, the

MedQuAD data consisting of 16,407 medical QA pairs, leveraging only 0.44% of
its trainable parameters to enhance computational efficiency. The paper adopts

BitsAndBytesConfig for efficient transformer training. The resulting model was
capable of outperforming other LLMs in medical question-answering tasks in
specific domains with greater accuracy utilizing limited computational
resources making it suitable for deployment in resource-constrained
environments. We propose further improvements through expanded datasets, larger

performing segmentation and classification in real time on embedded boards and
to highlight the different energy requirements of the studied implementations.
  Several other works develop the use of segmentation and feature extraction
techniques to detect glaucoma, among many other pathologies, with deep neural

complex pre-trained networks in very reasonable times.
  In this study, we evaluate the timing and energy performance of two EAS
equipped with Machine Learning (ML) accelerators executing an example
diagnostic tool developed in a previous work. For optic disc (OD) and cup (OC)
segmentation, the obtained prediction times per image are under 29 and 43 ms

  In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of employing four
state-of-the-art pretrained models for medical image retrieval at modality,
body region, and organ levels and compared the results of two similarity

the impacts of weighting and sampling strategies to incorporate 3D information

medical reports based on transcripts of medical consultations. The aim is to
reduce the administrative burden that healthcare professionals face. The
accuracy of the generated reports needs to be established to ensure their

large-scale models in the field of natural language processing has facilitated
rapid advancements in this technology. Existing medical dialogue models are
mostly based on BERT and pre-trained on English corpora, but there is a lack of
high-performing models on the task of Chinese medical dialogue generation. To

Objectives: Our study aims to provide systematic evidence on how the
de-identification of clinical free text has evolved in the last thirteen years,

"Explanatory Argument Extraction of Correct Answers in Resident Medical

research field. Thus, a number of large language models (LLMs) and automated
benchmarks have recently been proposed with the aim of facilitating information
extraction in Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) using natural language as a tool
for mediating in human-AI interaction. The most representative benchmarks are
limited to either multiple-choice or long-form answers and are available only
in English. In order to address these shortcomings, in this paper we present a
new dataset which, unlike previous work: (i) includes not only explanatory
arguments for the correct answer, but also arguments to reason why the
incorrect answers are not correct; (ii) the explanations are written originally
by medical doctors to answer questions from the Spanish Residency Medical
Exams. Furthermore, this new benchmark allows us to setup a novel extractive
task which consists of identifying the explanation of the correct answer
written by medical doctors. An additional benefit of our setting is that we can
leverage the extractive QA paradigm to automatically evaluate performance of
LLMs without resorting to costly manual evaluation by medical experts.
Comprehensive experimentation with language models for Spanish shows that
sometimes multilingual models fare better than monolingual ones, even
outperforming models which have been adapted to the medical domain.

From Beginner to Expert: Modeling Medical Knowledge into General LLMs,"Recently, large language model (LLM) based artificial intelligence (AI)
systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language
understanding and generation. However, these models face a significant
challenge when it comes to sensitive applications, such as reasoning over
medical knowledge and answering medical questions in a physician-like manner.
Prior studies attempted to overcome this challenge by increasing the model size
(>100B) to learn more general medical knowledge, while there is still room for
improvement in LLMs with smaller-scale model sizes (<100B). In this work, we
start from a pre-trained general LLM model (AntGLM-10B) and fine-tune it from a
medical beginner towards a medical expert (called AntGLM-Med-10B), which
leverages a 3-stage optimization procedure, i.e., general medical knowledge
injection, medical domain instruction tuning, and specific medical task
adaptation. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We specifically investigate
how to adapt a pre-trained general LLM in medical domain, especially for a
specific medical task. (2) We collect and construct large-scale medical
datasets for each stage of the optimization process. These datasets encompass
various data types and tasks, such as question-answering, medical reasoning,
multi-choice questions, and medical conversations. (3) Specifically for
multi-choice questions in the medical domain, we propose a novel
Verification-of-Choice approach for prompting engineering, which significantly

"MKA: A Scalable Medical Knowledge Assisted Mechanism for Generative
  Models on Medical Conversation Tasks","Using natural language processing (NLP) technologies to develop medical
chatbots makes the diagnosis of the patient more convenient and efficient,
which is a typical application in healthcare AI. Because of its importance,
lots of research have been come out. Recently, the neural generative models
have shown their impressive ability as the core of chatbot, while it cannot
scale well when directly applied to medical conversation due to the lack of
medical-specific knowledge. To address the limitation, a scalable Medical
Knowledge Assisted mechanism, MKA, is proposed in this paper. The mechanism
aims to assist general neural generative models to achieve better performance
on the medical conversation task. The medical-specific knowledge graph is
designed within the mechanism, which contains 6 types of medical-related
information, including department, drug, check, symptom, disease, food.
Besides, the specific token concatenation policy is defined to effectively
inject medical information into the input data. Evaluation of our method is
carried out on two typical medical datasets, MedDG and MedDialog-CN. The
evaluation results demonstrate that models combined with our mechanism
outperform original methods in multiple automatic evaluation metrics. Besides,

Detecting algorithmic bias in medical-AI models using trees,"With the growing prevalence of machine learning and artificial
intelligence-based medical decision support systems, it is equally important to
ensure that these systems provide patient outcomes in a fair and equitable
fashion. This paper presents an innovative framework for detecting areas of
algorithmic bias in medical-AI decision support systems. Our approach
efficiently identifies potential biases in medical-AI models, specifically in
the context of sepsis prediction, by employing the Classification and
Regression Trees (CART) algorithm with conformity scores. We verify our
methodology by conducting a series of synthetic data experiments, showcasing
its ability to estimate areas of bias in controlled settings precisely. The
effectiveness of the concept is further validated by experiments using
electronic medical records from Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia.
These tests demonstrate the practical implementation of our strategy in a

a novel model that leverages light graph convolutional networks (LGCN) and
augmentation memory networks (AMN) to enhance medication recommendation. LGCN
can efficiently encode the patient records and the DDI graph into
low-dimensional embeddings, while AMN can augment the patient representation

The Limits of Fair Medical Imaging AI In The Wild,"As artificial intelligence (AI) rapidly approaches human-level performance in
medical imaging, it is crucial that it does not exacerbate or propagate
healthcare disparities. Prior research has established AI's capacity to infer
demographic data from chest X-rays, leading to a key concern: do models using
demographic shortcuts have unfair predictions across subpopulations? In this
study, we conduct a thorough investigation into the extent to which medical AI
utilizes demographic encodings, focusing on potential fairness discrepancies
within both in-distribution training sets and external test sets. Our analysis
covers three key medical imaging disciplines: radiology, dermatology, and
ophthalmology, and incorporates data from six global chest X-ray datasets. We
confirm that medical imaging AI leverages demographic shortcuts in disease
classification. While correcting shortcuts algorithmically effectively
addresses fairness gaps to create ""locally optimal"" models within the original
data distribution, this optimality is not true in new test settings.
Surprisingly, we find that models with less encoding of demographic attributes
are often most ""globally optimal"", exhibiting better fairness during model
evaluation in new test environments. Our work establishes best practices for
medical imaging models which maintain their performance and fairness in
deployments beyond their initial training contexts, underscoring critical
considerations for AI clinical deployments across populations and sites.",2023-12-11,2023,2023-12,medical

more accurate and safe responses to medical-domain questions. To fine-tune
SM70, we used around 800K data entries from the publicly available dataset
MedAlpaca. The Llama2 70B open-sourced model served as the foundation for SM70,
and we employed the QLoRA technique for fine-tuning. The evaluation is
conducted across three benchmark datasets - MEDQA - USMLE, PUBMEDQA, and USMLE

medical data has become inevitable, necessitating the development of privacy
preserving machine learning algorithms that can train on distributed data.
Consolidating sensitive medical data is not always an option particularly due
to the stringent privacy regulations imposed by the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). In this paper, I introduce a HIPAA
compliant framework that can train from distributed data. I then propose a
multimodal vertical federated model for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection, a
serious neurodegenerative condition that can cause dementia, severely impairing

summaries is crucial for informed and timely patient care. Despite the
increasing complexity and volume of medical data, existing studies have focused
solely on text-based summarization, neglecting the integration of visual

relevant context generation module, the context filtration module for
distilling relevant medical concepts and knowledge, and finally, a
general-purpose LLM to generate visually aware medical question summaries.
Leveraging our MMQS dataset, we showcase how visual cues from images enhance

"MICA: Towards Explainable Skin Lesion Diagnosis via Multi-Level
  Image-Concept Alignment","Black-box deep learning approaches have showcased significant potential in
the realm of medical image analysis. However, the stringent trustworthiness
requirements intrinsic to the medical field have catalyzed research into the
utilization of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), with a particular
focus on concept-based methods. Existing concept-based methods predominantly
apply concept annotations from a single perspective (e.g., global level),
neglecting the nuanced semantic relationships between sub-regions and concepts
embedded within medical images. This leads to underutilization of the valuable
medical information and may cause models to fall short in harmoniously
balancing interpretability and performance when employing inherently
interpretable architectures such as Concept Bottlenecks. To mitigate these
shortcomings, we propose a multi-modal explainable disease diagnosis framework
that meticulously aligns medical images and clinical-related concepts
semantically at multiple strata, encompassing the image level, token level, and
concept level. Moreover, our method allows for model intervention and offers
both textual and visual explanations in terms of human-interpretable concepts.
Experimental results on three skin image datasets demonstrate that our method,
while preserving model interpretability, attains high performance and label
efficiency for concept detection and disease diagnosis.",2024-01-16,2024,2024-01,medical

contributions. First, as expert medical annotations are an expensive and
time-consuming bottleneck for scalable evaluation, we demonstrate that GPT-4 is
highly accurate in validating source relevance, agreeing 88% of the time with a
panel of medical doctors. Second, we develop an end-to-end, automated pipeline

different imaging modalities; A temporal loss that imparts the ability to
discern patterns over time; Medical-measure prediction adds appropriate medical

within the latent space. Despite the concern that multiple objectives could
weaken task performance, our findings show that this combination actually
boosts outcomes on certain tasks. Here, we apply this framework to both fundus
images and carotid ultrasound, and validate our downstream tasks capabilities
by predicting both current and future cardiovascular conditions. COMPRER

Large Language Model Distilling Medication Recommendation Model,"The recommendation of medication is a vital aspect of intelligent healthcare
systems, as it involves prescribing the most suitable drugs based on a
patient's specific health needs. Unfortunately, many sophisticated models
currently in use tend to overlook the nuanced semantics of medical data, while
only relying heavily on identities. Furthermore, these models face significant
challenges in handling cases involving patients who are visiting the hospital
for the first time, as they lack prior prescription histories to draw upon. To
tackle these issues, we harness the powerful semantic comprehension and
input-agnostic characteristics of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our research
aims to transform existing medication recommendation methodologies using LLMs.
In this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Large Language Model
Distilling Medication Recommendation (LEADER). We begin by creating appropriate
prompt templates that enable LLMs to suggest medications effectively. However,
the straightforward integration of LLMs into recommender systems leads to an
out-of-corpus issue specific to drugs. We handle it by adapting the LLMs with a
novel output layer and a refined tuning loss function. Although LLM-based
models exhibit remarkable capabilities, they are plagued by high computational
costs during inference, which is impractical for the healthcare sector. To
mitigate this, we have developed a feature-level knowledge distillation
technique, which transfers the LLM's proficiency to a more compact model.
Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets, MIMIC-III and

the diagnosis of medical ailments must be done by hand, as it is costly to
build a sufficiently broad LLM that can diagnose a wide range of diseases.
Here, we explore the use of vector databases and embedding models as a means of
encoding and classifying text with medical text data without the need to train
a new model altogether. We used various LLMs to generate the medical data, then
encoded the data with a text embedding model and stored it in a vector

descriptive data in the vector database would lead to better classifications
and designed a robustness test to test our hypothesis. By using vector

introduces Word-Sequence Entropy (WSE), a method that calibrates uncertainty at
both the word and sequence levels, considering semantic relevance. WSE
quantifies uncertainty in a way that is more closely aligned with the
reliability of LLMs during uncertainty quantification (UQ). We compare WSE with
six baseline methods on five free-form medical QA datasets, utilizing seven
popular large language models (LLMs). Experimental results demonstrate that WSE
exhibits superior performance in UQ under two standard criteria for correctness
evaluation. Additionally, in terms of real-world medical QA applications, the
performance of LLMs is significantly enhanced (e.g., a 6.36% improvement in
model accuracy on the COVID-QA dataset) by employing responses with lower
uncertainty that are identified by WSE as final answers, without any additional
task-specific fine-tuning or architectural modifications.",2024-02-22,2024,2024-02,medical
"Demographic Bias of Expert-Level Vision-Language Foundation Models in
  Medical Imaging","Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have achieved expert-level
performance in medical imaging applications. Notably, self-supervised
vision-language foundation models can detect a broad spectrum of pathologies
without relying on explicit training annotations. However, it is crucial to
ensure that these AI models do not mirror or amplify human biases, thereby
disadvantaging historically marginalized groups such as females or Black
patients. The manifestation of such biases could systematically delay essential
medical care for certain patient subgroups. In this study, we investigate the
algorithmic fairness of state-of-the-art vision-language foundation models in
chest X-ray diagnosis across five globally-sourced datasets. Our findings
reveal that compared to board-certified radiologists, these foundation models
consistently underdiagnose marginalized groups, with even higher rates seen in
intersectional subgroups, such as Black female patients. Such demographic
biases present over a wide range of pathologies and demographic attributes.
Further analysis of the model embedding uncovers its significant encoding of
demographic information. Deploying AI systems with these biases in medical
imaging can intensify pre-existing care disparities, posing potential
challenges to equitable healthcare access and raising ethical questions about
their clinical application.",2024-02-22,2024,2024-02,medical
"Adversarial-Robust Transfer Learning for Medical Imaging via Domain
  Assimilation","In the field of Medical Imaging, extensive research has been dedicated to
leveraging its potential in uncovering critical diagnostic features in
patients. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven medical diagnosis relies on
sophisticated machine learning and deep learning models to analyze, detect, and
identify diseases from medical images. Despite the remarkable performance of
these models, characterized by high accuracy, they grapple with trustworthiness
issues. The introduction of a subtle perturbation to the original image
empowers adversaries to manipulate the prediction output, redirecting it to
other targeted or untargeted classes. Furthermore, the scarcity of publicly
available medical images, constituting a bottleneck for reliable training, has
led contemporary algorithms to depend on pretrained models grounded on a large
set of natural images -- a practice referred to as transfer learning. However,
a significant {\em domain discrepancy} exists between natural and medical
images, which causes AI models resulting from transfer learning to exhibit
heightened {\em vulnerability} to adversarial attacks. This paper proposes a
{\em domain assimilation} approach that introduces texture and color adaptation
into transfer learning, followed by a texture preservation component to
suppress undesired distortion. We systematically analyze the performance of
transfer learning in the face of various adversarial attacks under different
data modalities, with the overarching goal of fortifying the model's robustness
and security in medical imaging tasks. The results demonstrate high
effectiveness in reducing attack efficacy, contributing toward more trustworthy
transfer learning in biomedical applications.",2024-02-25,2024,2024-02,medical

specialized-tasks and can be utilized to expand equitable access to medical
knowledge. Most medical LLMs have involved extensive fine-tuning, leveraging
specialized medical data and significant, thus costly, amounts of computational
power. Many of the top performing LLMs are proprietary and their access is
limited to very few research groups. However, open-source (OS) models represent
a key area of growth for medical LLMs due to significant improvements in
performance and an inherent ability to provide the transparency and compliance
required in healthcare. We present OpenMedLM, a prompting platform which
delivers state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for OS LLMs on medical benchmarks.
We evaluated a range of OS foundation LLMs (7B-70B) on four medical benchmarks

that OpenMedLM delivers OS SOTA results on three common medical LLM benchmarks,
surpassing the previous best performing OS models that leveraged
computationally costly extensive fine-tuning. The model delivers a 72.6%
accuracy on the MedQA benchmark, outperforming the previous SOTA by 2.4%, and
achieves 81.7% accuracy on the MMLU medical-subset, establishing itself as the
first OS LLM to surpass 80% accuracy on this benchmark. Our results highlight

"CIDGMed: Causal Inference-Driven Medication Recommendation with Enhanced
  Dual-Granularity Learning","Medication recommendation aims to integrate patients' long-term health
records to provide accurate and safe medication combinations for specific
health states. Existing methods often fail to deeply explore the true causal
relationships between diseases/procedures and medications, resulting in biased
recommendations. Additionally, in medication representation learning, the
relationships between information at different granularities of medications,
coarse-grained (medication itself) and fine-grained (molecular level), are not
effectively integrated, leading to biases in representation learning. To
address these limitations, we propose the Causal Inference-driven
Dual-Granularity Medication Recommendation method (CIDGMed). Our approach
leverages causal inference to uncover the relationships between
diseases/procedures and medications, thereby enhancing the rationality and
interpretability of recommendations. By integrating coarse-grained medication
effects with fine-grained molecular structure information, CIDGMed provides a
comprehensive representation of medications. Additionally, we employ a bias
correction model during the prediction phase to further refine recommendations,
ensuring both accuracy and safety. Through extensive experiments, CIDGMed
significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art models across multiple

"Medical Visual Prompting (MVP): A Unified Framework for Versatile and
  High-Quality Medical Image Segmentation","Accurate segmentation of lesion regions is crucial for clinical diagnosis and
treatment across various diseases. While deep convolutional networks have
achieved satisfactory results in medical image segmentation, they face
challenges such as loss of lesion shape information due to continuous
convolution and downsampling, as well as the high cost of manually labeling
lesions with varying shapes and sizes. To address these issues, we propose a
novel medical visual prompting (MVP) framework that leverages pre-training and
prompting concepts from natural language processing (NLP). The framework
utilizes three key components: Super-Pixel Guided Prompting (SPGP) for
superpixelating the input image, Image Embedding Guided Prompting (IEGP) for
freezing patch embedding and merging with superpixels to provide visual
prompts, and Adaptive Attention Mechanism Guided Prompting (AAGP) for
pinpointing prompt content and efficiently adapting all layers. By integrating
SPGP, IEGP, and AAGP, the MVP enables the segmentation network to better learn
shape prompting information and facilitates mutual learning across different
tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on five datasets demonstrate superior
performance of this method in various challenging medical image tasks, while
simplifying single-task medical segmentation models. This novel framework
offers improved performance with fewer parameters and holds significant
potential for accurate segmentation of lesion regions in various medical tasks,
making it clinically valuable.",2024-04-01,2024,2024-04,medical
"Data-Efficient Unsupervised Interpolation Without Any Intermediate Frame
  for 4D Medical Images","4D medical images, which represent 3D images with temporal information, are
crucial in clinical practice for capturing dynamic changes and monitoring
long-term disease progression. However, acquiring 4D medical images poses
challenges due to factors such as radiation exposure and imaging duration,
necessitating a balance between achieving high temporal resolution and
minimizing adverse effects. Given these circumstances, not only is data
acquisition challenging, but increasing the frame rate for each dataset also
proves difficult. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a simple yet
effective Unsupervised Volumetric Interpolation framework, UVI-Net. This
framework facilitates temporal interpolation without the need for any
intermediate frames, distinguishing it from the majority of other existing
unsupervised methods. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate significant
improvements across diverse evaluation metrics compared to unsupervised and
supervised baselines. Remarkably, our approach achieves this superior
performance even when trained with a dataset as small as one, highlighting its
exceptional robustness and efficiency in scenarios with sparse supervision.

obstructed by the paucity of data. In this paper, we investigate the
effectiveness of data-based few-shot learning in medical imaging by exploring
different data attribute representations in a low-dimensional space. We
introduce different types of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) in
few-shot learning, addressing the data scarcity issue in medical image

validating the effectiveness of NMF, especially its supervised variants (e.g.,
discriminative NMF, and supervised and constrained NMF with sparseness), and
the comparison with principal component analysis (PCA), i.e., the collaborative
representation-based dimensionality reduction technique derived from
eigenvectors. With 14 different datasets covering 11 distinct illness

clinical decision-making by interpreting various types of medical data.
However, the effectiveness of these models across all medical fields is
uncertain. Each discipline presents unique challenges that need to be addressed

to integrate different fields into a single model. Here, we introduce an
alternative approach to multimodal medical AI that utilizes the generalist
capabilities of a large language model (LLM) as a central reasoning engine.
This engine autonomously coordinates and deploys a set of specialized medical
AI tools. These tools include text, radiology and histopathology image

development of Artificial Intelligence technology to assist medical experts for
interactive decision support, which has been demonstrated by their competitive
performances in Medical QA. However, while impressive, the required quality bar

Specifically, CausalMed first captures the causal relationship between
diseases/procedures and medications through causal discovery and evaluates
their causal effects. Building upon this, CausalMed focuses on analyzing the
health state of patients, capturing the dynamic differences of
diseases/procedures in different health states of patients, and transforming

"COIN: Counterfactual inpainting for weakly supervised semantic
  segmentation for medical images","Deep learning is dramatically transforming the field of medical imaging and
radiology, enabling the identification of pathologies in medical images,
including computed tomography (CT) and X-ray scans. However, the performance of
deep learning models, particularly in segmentation tasks, is often limited by
the need for extensive annotated datasets. To address this challenge, the
capabilities of weakly supervised semantic segmentation are explored through
the lens of Explainable AI and the generation of counterfactual explanations.
The scope of this research is development of a novel counterfactual inpainting
approach (COIN) that flips the predicted classification label from abnormal to
normal by using a generative model. For instance, if the classifier deems an
input medical image X as abnormal, indicating the presence of a pathology, the
generative model aims to inpaint the abnormal region, thus reversing the
classifier's original prediction label. The approach enables us to produce
precise segmentations for pathologies without depending on pre-existing
segmentation masks. Crucially, image-level labels are utilized, which are
substantially easier to acquire than creating detailed segmentation masks. The
effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by segmenting synthetic targets and
actual kidney tumors from CT images acquired from Tartu University Hospital in
Estonia. The findings indicate that COIN greatly surpasses established
attribution methods, such as RISE, ScoreCAM, and LayerCAM, as well as an
alternative counterfactual explanation method introduced by Singla et al. This

academic exploration. Transparent, comprehensive access to LLM resources is
essential for advancing the field, fostering reproducibility, and encouraging
innovation in healthcare AI. We present Hippocrates, an open-source LLM
framework specifically developed for the medical domain. In stark contrast to
previous efforts, it offers unrestricted access to its training datasets,
codebase, checkpoints, and evaluation protocols. This open approach is designed
to stimulate collaborative research, allowing the community to build upon,
refine, and rigorously evaluate medical LLMs within a transparent ecosystem.
Also, we introduce Hippo, a family of 7B models tailored for the medical
domain, fine-tuned from Mistral and LLaMA2 through continual pre-training,
instruction tuning, and reinforcement learning from human and AI feedback. Our
models outperform existing open medical LLMs models by a large-margin, even
surpassing models with 70B parameters. Through Hippocrates, we aspire to unlock
the full potential of LLMs not just to advance medical knowledge and patient

"Processing HSV Colored Medical Images and Adapting Color Thresholds for
  Computational Image Analysis: a Practical Introduction to an open-source tool","Background: Using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for computational
medical image analysis has shown promising results. However, colored images are
often not readily available for AI analysis because of different coloring
thresholds used across centers and physicians as well as the removal of
clinical annotations. We aimed to develop an open-source tool that can adapt
different color thresholds of HSV-colored medical images and remove annotations
with a simple click.
  Materials and Methods: We built a function using MATLAB and used multi-center
international shear wave elastography data (NCT 02638935) to test the function.
We provide step-by-step instructions with accompanying code lines.
  Results: We demonstrate that the newly developed pre-processing function
successfully removed letters and adapted different color thresholds of
HSV-colored medical images.
  Conclusion: We developed an open-source tool for removing letters and
adapting different color thresholds in HSV-colored medical images. We hope this
contributes to advancing medical image processing for developing robust

"MEDVOC: Vocabulary Adaptation for Fine-tuning Pre-trained Language
  Models on Medical Text Summarization","This work presents a dynamic vocabulary adaptation strategy, MEDVOC, for
fine-tuning pre-trained language models (PLMs) like BertSumAbs, BART, and
PEGASUS for improved medical text summarization. In contrast to existing domain
adaptation approaches in summarization, MEDVOC treats vocabulary as an
optimizable parameter and optimizes the PLM vocabulary based on fragment score
conditioned only on the downstream task's reference summaries. Unlike previous
works on vocabulary adaptation (limited only to classification tasks),
optimizing vocabulary based on summarization tasks requires an extremely costly
intermediate fine-tuning step on large summarization datasets. To that end, our
novel fragment score-based hyperparameter search very significantly reduces
this fine-tuning time -- from 450 days to less than 2 days on average.
Furthermore, while previous works on vocabulary adaptation are often primarily
tied to single PLMs, MEDVOC is designed to be deployable across multiple PLMs
(with varying model vocabulary sizes, pre-training objectives, and model sizes)
-- bridging the limited vocabulary overlap between the biomedical literature
domain and PLMs. MEDVOC outperforms baselines by 15.74% in terms of Rouge-L in
zero-shot setting and shows gains of 17.29% in high Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV)

large language model as a learnable orchestrator, MedVersa can learn from both
visual and linguistic supervision, support multimodal inputs, and perform
real-time task specification. This versatility allows MedVersa to adapt to
various clinical scenarios and perform multifaceted medical image analysis. We
introduce MedInterp, the largest multimodal dataset to date for medical image

"MoVL:Exploring Fusion Strategies for the Domain-Adaptive Application of
  Pretrained Models in Medical Imaging Tasks","Medical images are often more difficult to acquire than natural images due to
the specialism of the equipment and technology, which leads to less medical

linear probe (LP). However, LP only considers the output after feature
extraction. Yet, there exists a gap between input medical images and natural
pretrained vision model. We introduce visual prompting (VP) to fill in the gap,
and analyze the strategies of coupling between LP and VP. We design a joint

which describe the variance of prompted and plain images, naming this joint
training strategy MoVL (Mixture of Visual Prompting and Linear Probe). We
experiment on 4 medical image classification datasets, with two mainstream

context of radiology image retrieval. However, a benchmark for the retrieval of
3D volumetric medical images is still lacking, hindering the ability to

"PriCE: Privacy-Preserving and Cost-Effective Scheduling for
  Parallelizing the Large Medical Image Processing Workflow over Hybrid Clouds","Running deep neural networks for large medical images is a resource-hungry
and time-consuming task with centralized computing. Outsourcing such medical
image processing tasks to hybrid clouds has benefits, such as a significant
reduction of execution time and monetary cost. However, due to privacy
concerns, it is still challenging to process sensitive medical images over
clouds, which would hinder their deployment in many real-world applications. To
overcome this, we first formulate the overall optimization objectives of the
privacy-preserving distributed system model, i.e., minimizing the amount of
information about the private data learned by the adversaries throughout the
process, reducing the maximum execution time and cost under the user budget
constraint. We propose a novel privacy-preserving and cost-effective method
called PriCE to solve this multi-objective optimization problem. We performed
extensive simulation experiments for artifact detection tasks on medical images
using an ensemble of five deep convolutional neural network inferences as the
workflow task. Experimental results show that PriCE successfully splits a wide
range of input gigapixel medical images with graph-coloring-based strategies,
yielding desired output utility and lowering the privacy risk, makespan, and
monetary cost under user's budget.",2024-05-24,2024,2024-05,medical

"Medical MLLM is Vulnerable: Cross-Modality Jailbreak and Mismatched
  Attacks on Medical Multimodal Large Language Models","Security concerns related to Large Language Models (LLMs) have been
extensively explored, yet the safety implications for Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs), particularly in medical contexts (MedMLLMs), remain
insufficiently studied. This paper delves into the underexplored security
vulnerabilities of MedMLLMs, especially when deployed in clinical environments
where the accuracy and relevance of question-and-answer interactions are
critically tested against complex medical challenges. By combining existing
clinical medical data with atypical natural phenomena, we define the mismatched
malicious attack (2M-attack) and introduce its optimized version, known as the
optimized mismatched malicious attack (O2M-attack or 2M-optimization). Using
the voluminous 3MAD dataset that we construct, which covers a wide range of
medical image modalities and harmful medical scenarios, we conduct a
comprehensive analysis and propose the MCM optimization method, which
significantly enhances the attack success rate on MedMLLMs. Evaluations with
this dataset and attack methods, including white-box attacks on LLaVA-Med and
transfer attacks (black-box) on four other SOTA models, indicate that even
MedMLLMs designed with enhanced security features remain vulnerable to security
breaches. Our work underscores the urgent need for a concerted effort to
implement robust security measures and enhance the safety and efficacy of

Enhancement (AIDME) Study. OBJECTIVES: 1) Develop a model capable of predicting
probabilities of remission across multiple pharmacological treatments for
adults with at least moderate major depression. 2) Validate model predictions
and examine them for amplification of harmful biases. METHODS: Data from
previous clinical trials of antidepressant medications were standardized into a
common framework and included 9,042 adults with moderate to severe major
depression. Feature selection retained 25 clinical and demographic variables.
Using Bayesian optimization, a deep learning model was trained on the training
set, refined using the validation set, and tested once on the held-out test
set. RESULTS: In the evaluation on the held-out test set, the model
demonstrated achieved an AUC of 0.65. The model outperformed a null model on

Adversarial Attacks on Large Language Models in Medicine,"The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into healthcare applications
offers promising advancements in medical diagnostics, treatment
recommendations, and patient care. However, the susceptibility of LLMs to
adversarial attacks poses a significant threat, potentially leading to harmful
outcomes in delicate medical contexts. This study investigates the
vulnerability of LLMs to two types of adversarial attacks in three medical
tasks. Utilizing real-world patient data, we demonstrate that both open-source
and proprietary LLMs are susceptible to manipulation across multiple tasks.
This research further reveals that domain-specific tasks demand more
adversarial data in model fine-tuning than general domain tasks for effective
attack execution, especially for more capable models. We discover that while
integrating adversarial data does not markedly degrade overall model
performance on medical benchmarks, it does lead to noticeable shifts in
fine-tuned model weights, suggesting a potential pathway for detecting and
countering model attacks. This research highlights the urgent need for robust
security measures and the development of defensive mechanisms to safeguard LLMs
in medical applications, to ensure their safe and effective deployment in
healthcare settings.",2024-06-18,2024,2024-06,medical
"Reasoning Like a Doctor: Improving Medical Dialogue Systems via
  Diagnostic Reasoning Process Alignment","Medical dialogue systems have attracted significant attention for their
potential to act as medical assistants. Enabling these medical systems to
emulate clinicians' diagnostic reasoning process has been the long-standing
research focus. Previous studies rudimentarily realized the simulation of
clinicians' diagnostic process by fine-tuning language models on high-quality
dialogue datasets. Nonetheless, they overly focus on the outcomes of the
clinician's reasoning process while ignoring their internal thought processes
and alignment with clinician preferences. Our work aims to build a medical
dialogue system that aligns with clinicians' diagnostic reasoning processes. We
propose a novel framework, Emulation, designed to generate an appropriate
response that relies on abductive and deductive diagnostic reasoning analyses
and aligns with clinician preferences through thought process modeling.
Experimental results on two datasets confirm the efficacy of Emulation.
Crucially, our framework furnishes clear explanations for the generated
responses, enhancing its transparency in medical consultations.",2024-06-20,2024,2024-06,medical
A Data-Driven Guided Decoding Mechanism for Diagnostic Captioning,"Diagnostic Captioning (DC) automatically generates a diagnostic text from one
or more medical images (e.g., X-rays, MRIs) of a patient. Treated as a draft,
the generated text may assist clinicians, by providing an initial estimation of
the patient's condition, speeding up and helping safeguard the diagnostic
process. The accuracy of a diagnostic text, however, strongly depends on how
well the key medical conditions depicted in the images are expressed. We
propose a new data-driven guided decoding method that incorporates medical
information, in the form of existing tags capturing key conditions of the
image(s), into the beam search of the diagnostic text generation process. We
evaluate the proposed method on two medical datasets using four DC systems that
range from generic image-to-text systems with CNN encoders and RNN decoders to
pre-trained Large Language Models. The latter can also be used in few- and
zero-shot learning scenarios. In most cases, the proposed mechanism improves
performance with respect to all evaluation measures. We provide an open-source
implementation of the proposed method at https://github.com/nlpaueb/dmmcs.",2024-06-20,2024,2024-06,medical
Human-AI collectives produce the most accurate differential diagnoses,"Artificial intelligence systems, particularly large language models (LLMs),
are increasingly being employed in high-stakes decisions that impact both
individuals and society at large, often without adequate safeguards to ensure
safety, quality, and equity. Yet LLMs hallucinate, lack common sense, and are
biased - shortcomings that may reflect LLMs' inherent limitations and thus may
not be remedied by more sophisticated architectures, more data, or more human
feedback. Relying solely on LLMs for complex, high-stakes decisions is
therefore problematic. Here we present a hybrid collective intelligence system
that mitigates these risks by leveraging the complementary strengths of human
experience and the vast information processed by LLMs. We apply our method to
open-ended medical diagnostics, combining 40,762 differential diagnoses made by
physicians with the diagnoses of five state-of-the art LLMs across 2,133
medical cases. We show that hybrid collectives of physicians and LLMs
outperform both single physicians and physician collectives, as well as single
LLMs and LLM ensembles. This result holds across a range of medical specialties
and professional experience, and can be attributed to humans' and LLMs'
complementary contributions that lead to different kinds of errors. Our
approach highlights the potential for collective human and machine intelligence
to improve accuracy in complex, open-ended domains like medical diagnostics.",2024-06-21,2024,2024-06,medical

grown, driven by their promising potential. Releasing these models into
production requires properly understanding their behavior, particularly in
sensitive domains like medicine. Despite this need, the medical literature
still lacks practical assessment of pre-trained language models, which are
especially valuable in settings where only consumer-grade computational
resources are available. To address this gap, we have conducted a comprehensive
survey of language models in the medical field and evaluated a subset of these
for medical text classification and conditional text generation. The subset
includes 53 models with 110 million to 13 billion parameters, spanning the
Transformer-based model families and knowledge domains. Different approaches
are employed for text classification, including zero-shot learning, enabling
tuning without the need to train the model. These approaches are helpful in our
target settings, where many users of language models find themselves. The
results reveal remarkable performance across the tasks and datasets evaluated,
underscoring the potential of certain models to contain medical knowledge, even

standardized prompt to evaluate resumes for specific residency programs.
Explicit bias was tested by changing gender and race information, while
implicit bias was tested by changing names while hiding race and gender.
Physician data from the Association of American Medical Colleges was used to
compare with real-world demographics. 900,000 resumes were evaluated. All LLMs

significantly affecting the medical field. Notably, Gemini-Vision-series
(Gemini) and GPT-4-series (GPT-4) models have epitomized a paradigm shift in
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) for computer vision, showcasing their
potential in the biomedical domain. In this study, we evaluated the performance
of the Gemini, GPT-4, and 4 popular large models for an exhaustive evaluation
across 14 medical imaging datasets, including 5 medical imaging categories
(dermatology, radiology, dentistry, ophthalmology, and endoscopy), and 3
radiology report datasets. The investigated tasks encompass disease
classification, lesion segmentation, anatomical localization, disease
diagnosis, report generation, and lesion detection. Our experimental results
demonstrated that Gemini-series models excelled in report generation and lesion
detection but faces challenges in disease classification and anatomical
localization. Conversely, GPT-series models exhibited proficiency in lesion
segmentation and anatomical localization but encountered difficulties in
disease diagnosis and lesion detection. Additionally, both the Gemini series
and GPT series contain models that have demonstrated commendable generation
efficiency. While both models hold promise in reducing physician workload,
alleviating pressure on limited healthcare resources, and fostering
collaboration between clinical practitioners and artificial intelligence
technologies, substantial enhancements and comprehensive validations remain
imperative before clinical deployment.",2024-07-08,2024,2024-07,medical
"Promoting AI Competencies for Medical Students: A Scoping Review on
  Frameworks, Programs, and Tools","As more clinical workflows continue to be augmented by artificial
intelligence (AI), AI literacy among physicians will become a critical
requirement for ensuring safe and ethical AI-enabled patient care. Despite the
evolving importance of AI in healthcare, the extent to which it has been
adopted into traditional and often-overloaded medical curricula is currently
unknown. In a scoping review of 1,699 articles published between January 2016
and June 2024, we identified 18 studies which propose guiding frameworks, and
11 studies documenting real-world instruction, centered around the integration
of AI into medical education. We found that comprehensive guidelines will
require greater clinical relevance and personalization to suit medical student
interests and career trajectories. Current efforts highlight discrepancies in
the teaching guidelines, emphasizing AI evaluation and ethics over technical
topics such as data science and coding. Additionally, we identified several
challenges associated with integrating AI training into the medical education
program, including a lack of guidelines to define medical students AI literacy,
a perceived lack of proven clinical value, and a scarcity of qualified
instructors. With this knowledge, we propose an AI literacy framework to define
competencies for medical students. To prioritize relevant and personalized AI
education, we categorize literacy into four dimensions: Foundational,
Practical, Experimental, and Ethical, with tailored learning objectives to the
pre-clinical, clinical, and clinical research stages of medical education. This

Weakly-supervised Medical Image Segmentation with Gaze Annotations,"Eye gaze that reveals human observational patterns has increasingly been
incorporated into solutions for vision tasks. Despite recent explorations on
leveraging gaze to aid deep networks, few studies exploit gaze as an efficient
annotation approach for medical image segmentation which typically entails
heavy annotating costs. In this paper, we propose to collect dense weak
supervision for medical image segmentation with a gaze annotation scheme. To
train with gaze, we propose a multi-level framework that trains multiple
networks from discriminative human attention, simulated with a set of
pseudo-masks derived by applying hierarchical thresholds on gaze heatmaps.
Furthermore, to mitigate gaze noise, a cross-level consistency is exploited to
regularize overfitting noisy labels, steering models toward clean patterns
learned by peer networks. The proposed method is validated on two public
medical datasets of polyp and prostate segmentation tasks. We contribute a
high-quality gaze dataset entitled GazeMedSeg as an extension to the popular
medical segmentation datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
gaze dataset for medical image segmentation. Our experiments demonstrate that
gaze annotation outperforms previous label-efficient annotation schemes in
terms of both performance and annotation time. Our collected gaze data and code

"FedMedICL: Towards Holistic Evaluation of Distribution Shifts in
  Federated Medical Imaging","For medical imaging AI models to be clinically impactful, they must
generalize. However, this goal is hindered by (i) diverse types of distribution
shifts, such as temporal, demographic, and label shifts, and (ii) limited
diversity in datasets that are siloed within single medical institutions. While
these limitations have spurred interest in federated learning, current
evaluation benchmarks fail to evaluate different shifts simultaneously.
However, in real healthcare settings, multiple types of shifts co-exist, yet
their impact on medical imaging performance remains unstudied. In response, we
introduce FedMedICL, a unified framework and benchmark to holistically evaluate
federated medical imaging challenges, simultaneously capturing label,
demographic, and temporal distribution shifts. We comprehensively evaluate
several popular methods on six diverse medical imaging datasets (totaling 550
GPU hours). Furthermore, we use FedMedICL to simulate COVID-19 propagation
across hospitals and evaluate whether methods can adapt to pandemic changes in
disease prevalence. We find that a simple batch balancing technique surpasses
advanced methods in average performance across FedMedICL experiments. This

"Explainable artificial intelligence in breast cancer detection and risk
  prediction: A systematic scoping review","With the advances in artificial intelligence (AI), data-driven algorithms are
becoming increasingly popular in the medical domain. However, due to the
nonlinear and complex behavior of many of these algorithms, decision-making by
such algorithms is not trustworthy for clinicians and is considered a black-box
process. Hence, the scientific community has introduced explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) to remedy the problem. This systematic scoping review
investigates the application of XAI in breast cancer detection and risk
prediction. We conducted a comprehensive search on Scopus, IEEE Explore,
PubMed, and Google Scholar (first 50 citations) using a systematic search
strategy. The search spanned from January 2017 to July 2023, focusing on
peer-reviewed studies implementing XAI methods in breast cancer datasets.
Thirty studies met our inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis.
The results revealed that SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is the top
model-agnostic XAI technique in breast cancer research in terms of usage,
explaining the model prediction results, diagnosis and classification of
biomarkers, and prognosis and survival analysis. Additionally, the SHAP model
primarily explained tree-based ensemble machine learning models. The most
common reason is that SHAP is model agnostic, which makes it both popular and
useful for explaining any model prediction. Additionally, it is relatively easy
to implement effectively and completely suits performant models, such as
tree-based models. Explainable AI improves the transparency, interpretability,

"Fine-Tuning Medical Language Models for Enhanced Long-Contextual
  Understanding and Domain Expertise","Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely applied in various professional
fields. By fine-tuning the models using domain specific question and answer
datasets, the professional domain knowledge and Q\&A abilities of these models

fine-tuning of doctor-patient Q\&A data exhibit extraordinary disease
diagnostic abilities. However, we observed that despite improvements in
specific domain knowledge, the performance of medical LLM in long-context
understanding has significantly declined, especially compared to general
language models with similar parameters. The purpose of this study is to
investigate the phenomenon of reduced performance in understanding long-context
in medical LLM. We designed a series of experiments to conduct open-book
professional knowledge exams on all models to evaluate their ability to read
long-context. By adjusting the proportion and quantity of general data and
medical data in the process of fine-tuning, we can determine the best data
composition to optimize the professional model and achieve a balance between

dissemination of medical knowledge across languages. However, complex medical
terminology poses unique challenges to achieving adequate translation quality

develop supervised neural machine translation models optimized specifically for
medical texts. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful
capabilities, this research shows that small, specialized models trained on
high-quality in-domain (mostly synthetic) data can outperform even vastly
larger LLMs.
  Custom parallel corpora in six languages were compiled from scientific
articles, synthetically generated clinical documents, and medical texts. Our
LLMs-in-the-loop methodology employs synthetic data generation, rigorous
evaluation, and agent orchestration to enhance performance. We developed small
medical translation models using the MarianMT base model. We introduce a new
medical translation test dataset to standardize evaluation in this domain.
Assessed using BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and BERT scores on this test set, our
MarianMT-based models outperform Google Translate, DeepL, and GPT-4-Turbo.
  Results demonstrate that our LLMs-in-the-loop approach, combined with
fine-tuning high-quality, domain-specific data, enables specialized models to

"Addressing Imbalance for Class Incremental Learning in Medical Image
  Classification","Deep convolutional neural networks have made significant breakthroughs in
medical image classification, under the assumption that training samples from
all classes are simultaneously available. However, in real-world medical
scenarios, there's a common need to continuously learn about new diseases,
leading to the emerging field of class incremental learning (CIL) in the
medical domain. Typically, CIL suffers from catastrophic forgetting when
trained on new classes. This phenomenon is mainly caused by the imbalance
between old and new classes, and it becomes even more challenging with
imbalanced medical datasets. In this work, we introduce two simple yet
effective plug-in methods to mitigate the adverse effects of the imbalance.
First, we propose a CIL-balanced classification loss to mitigate the classifier
bias toward majority classes via logit adjustment. Second, we propose a
distribution margin loss that not only alleviates the inter-class overlap in
embedding space but also enforces the intra-class compactness. We evaluate the
effectiveness of our method with extensive experiments on three benchmark
datasets (CCH5000, HAM10000, and EyePACS). The results demonstrate that our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",2024-07-18,2024,2024-07,medical

achieve memory-efficient, few-shot medical image segmentation by applying
Gradient Low-Rank Projection GaLore to the parameters of the image encoder of
SAM. Meanwhile, the weights of the prompt encoder and mask decoder undergo full

few-shot learning capabilities, reporting on its memory efficiency and
segmentation performance across multiple standard medical image segmentation
datasets. We compare it with several baseline models, including LoRA fine-tuned
SAM (SAMed) and DAE-Former. Experiments across multiple datasets and these
baseline models with different number of images for fine tuning demonstrated
that the GPU memory consumption of MedSAGa is significantly less than that of
the baseline models, achieving an average memory efficiency of 66% more than
current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models for medical image segmentation. The
combination of substantially lower memory requirements and comparable to SOTA

Prompt Injection Attacks on Large Language Models in Oncology,"Vision-language artificial intelligence models (VLMs) possess medical
knowledge and can be employed in healthcare in numerous ways, including as
image interpreters, virtual scribes, and general decision support systems.
However, here, we demonstrate that current VLMs applied to medical tasks
exhibit a fundamental security flaw: they can be attacked by prompt injection
attacks, which can be used to output harmful information just by interacting
with the VLM, without any access to its parameters. We performed a quantitative
study to evaluate the vulnerabilities to these attacks in four state of the art
VLMs which have been proposed to be of utility in healthcare: Claude 3 Opus,
Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Reka Core, and GPT-4o. Using a set of N=297 attacks, we show
that all of these models are susceptible. Specifically, we show that embedding
sub-visual prompts in medical imaging data can cause the model to provide
harmful output, and that these prompts are non-obvious to human observers.
Thus, our study demonstrates a key vulnerability in medical VLMs which should
be mitigated before widespread clinical adoption.",2024-07-23,2024,2024-07,medical
"An Active Inference Strategy for Prompting Reliable Responses from Large
  Language Models in Medical Practice","Continuing advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) in artificial
intelligence offer important capacities in intuitively accessing and using
medical knowledge in many contexts, including education and training as well as
assessment and treatment. Most of the initial literature on LLMs in medicine
has emphasized that LLMs are unsuitable for medical use because they are
non-deterministic, may provide incorrect or harmful responses, and cannot be
regulated to assure quality control. If these issues could be corrected,
optimizing LLM technology could benefit patients and physicians by providing
affordable, point-of-care medical knowledge. Our proposed framework refines LLM
responses by restricting their primary knowledge base to domain-specific
datasets containing validated medical information. Additionally, we introduce
an actor-critic LLM prompting protocol based on active inference principles of
human cognition, where a Therapist agent initially responds to patient queries,
and a Supervisor agent evaluates and adjusts responses to ensure accuracy and
reliability. We conducted a validation study where expert cognitive behaviour
therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) therapists evaluated responses from the LLM in a
blind format. Experienced human CBT-I therapists assessed responses to 100
patient queries, comparing LLM-generated responses with appropriate and
inappropriate responses crafted by experienced CBT-I therapists. Results showed
that LLM responses received high ratings from the CBT-I therapists, often
exceeding those of therapist-generated appropriate responses. This structured
approach aims to integrate advanced LLM technology into medical applications,

Robust Conformal Volume Estimation in 3D Medical Images,"Volumetry is one of the principal downstream applications of 3D medical image
segmentation, for example, to detect abnormal tissue growth or for surgery
planning. Conformal Prediction is a promising framework for uncertainty
quantification, providing calibrated predictive intervals associated with
automatic volume measurements. However, this methodology is based on the
hypothesis that calibration and test samples are exchangeable, an assumption
that is in practice often violated in medical image applications. A weighted
formulation of Conformal Prediction can be framed to mitigate this issue, but
its empirical investigation in the medical domain is still lacking. A potential
reason is that it relies on the estimation of the density ratio between the
calibration and test distributions, which is likely to be intractable in
scenarios involving high-dimensional data. To circumvent this, we propose an
efficient approach for density ratio estimation relying on the compressed
latent representations generated by the segmentation model. Our experiments

loses many important details. This motivates us to build AI models that can
communicate fine-grained knowledge from medical images like human experts. To
this end, we first propose a new benchmark on fine granularity learning from

knowledge to divide positive cases into two subcategories, namely atypical
positive and typical positive. Then, we propose a new metric termed
AUC$^\text{FG}$ on the two subcategories for evaluation of the ability to
separate them apart. With the proposed benchmark, we encourage the community to
develop AI diagnosis systems that could better learn fine granularity from

participants gave evaluations for medical responses that were either written by
a medical doctor on an online healthcare platform, or generated by a large

Results showed that participants could not effectively distinguish between
AI-generated and Doctors' responses and demonstrated a preference for
AI-generated responses, rating High Accuracy AI-generated responses as
significantly more valid, trustworthy, and complete/satisfactory. Low Accuracy
AI-generated responses on average performed very similar to Doctors' responses,
if not more. Participants not only found these low-accuracy AI-generated

indicated a high tendency to follow the potentially harmful medical advice and
incorrectly seek unnecessary medical attention as a result of the response
provided. This problematic reaction was comparable if not more to the reaction

generating medical reports from retinal images rely on manual interpretation,
which is time-consuming and prone to errors, further straining
ophthalmologists' limited resources. This thesis investigates the potential of
Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automate medical report generation for retinal

systems can greatly enhance the efficiency of retinal disease diagnosis,
reducing doctors' workloads and enabling them to focus on more complex cases.
The proposed AI-based methods address key challenges in automated report

deep learning approach captures interactions between textual keywords and
retinal images, resulting in more comprehensive medical reports; (3) Techniques
to enhance the interpretability of the AI-based report generation system,

Quantization is an effective solution for model compression; however,

"Development and Validation of Heparin Dosing Policies Using an Offline
  Reinforcement Learning Algorithm","Appropriate medication dosages in the intensive care unit (ICU) are critical
for patient survival. Heparin, used to treat thrombosis and inhibit blood
clotting in the ICU, requires careful administration due to its complexity and
sensitivity to various factors, including patient clinical characteristics,
underlying medical conditions, and potential drug interactions. Incorrect
dosing can lead to severe complications such as strokes or excessive bleeding.
To address these challenges, this study proposes a reinforcement learning
(RL)-based personalized optimal heparin dosing policy that guides dosing
decisions reliably within the therapeutic range based on individual patient
conditions. A batch-constrained policy was implemented to minimize
out-of-distribution errors in an offline RL environment and effectively
integrate RL with existing clinician policies. The policy's effectiveness was
evaluated using weighted importance sampling, an off-policy evaluation method,
and the relationship between state representations and Q-values was explored
using t-SNE. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses were conducted using
the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database,
demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed RL-based medication policy.
Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and extensive clinical data,
this research enhances heparin administration practices and establishes a

"CBIDR: A novel method for information retrieval combining image and data
  by means of TOPSIS applied to medical diagnosis","Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) have shown promising results in the
field of medical diagnosis, which aims to provide support to medical
professionals (doctor or pathologist). However, the ultimate decision regarding
the diagnosis is made by the medical professional, drawing upon their
accumulated experience. In this context, we believe that artificial
intelligence can play a pivotal role in addressing the challenges in medical
diagnosis not by making the final decision but by assisting in the diagnosis
process with the most relevant information. The CBIR methods use similarity
metrics to compare feature vectors generated from images using Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs). In addition to the information contained in medical
images, clinical data about the patient is often available and is also relevant
in the final decision-making process by medical professionals. In this paper,
we propose a novel method named CBIDR, which leverage both medical images and
clinical data of patient, combining them through the ranking algorithm TOPSIS.
The goal is to aid medical professionals in their final diagnosis by retrieving
images and clinical data of patient that are most similar to query data from
the database. As a case study, we illustrate our CBIDR for diagnostic of oral
cancer including histopathological images and clinical data of patient.
Experimental results in terms of accuracy achieved 97.44% in Top-1 and 100% in

unlabeled data and learning high-level semantics without annotations. We
observe that 3D medical images exhibit consistent geometric context, i.e.,
consistent geometric relations between different organs, which leads to a
promising way for learning consistent representations. Motivated by this, we
introduce a simple-yet-effective Volume Contrast (VoCo) framework to leverage
geometric context priors for self-supervision. Given an input volume, we

Enabling Scalable Evaluation of Bias Patterns in Medical LLMs,"Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive potential in helping with
numerous medical challenges. Deploying LLMs in high-stakes applications such as

deployment of Med LLMs, rigorous evaluation is a key prerequisite. Due to the
huge complexity and variability of different medical scenarios, existing work

evaluation. In this study, we present a new method to scale up such bias
evaluations by automatically generating test cases based on rigorous medical

"MMDS: A Multimodal Medical Diagnosis System Integrating Image Analysis
  and Knowledge-based Departmental Consultation","We present MMDS, a system capable of recognizing medical images and patient
facial details, and providing professional medical diagnoses. The system
consists of two core components:The first component is the analysis of medical
images and videos. We trained a specialized multimodal medical model capable of
interpreting medical images and accurately analyzing patients' facial emotions
and facial paralysis conditions. The model achieved an accuracy of 72.59% on
the FER2013 facial emotion recognition dataset, with a 91.1% accuracy in
recognizing the ""happy"" emotion. In facial paralysis recognition, the model
reached an accuracy of 92%, which is 30% higher than that of GPT-4o. Based on
this model, we developed a parser for analyzing facial movement videos of
patients with facial paralysis, achieving precise grading of the paralysis
severity. In tests on 30 videos of facial paralysis patients, the system
demonstrated a grading accuracy of 83.3%.The second component is the generation
of professional medical responses. We employed a large language model,
integrated with a medical knowledge base, to generate professional diagnoses
based on the analysis of medical images or videos. The core innovation lies in
our development of a department-specific knowledge base routing management
mechanism, in which the large language model categorizes data by medical
departments and, during the retrieval process, determines the appropriate
knowledge base to query. This significantly improves retrieval accuracy in the
RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) process.",2024-10-20,2024,2024-10,medical
"Concept Complement Bottleneck Model for Interpretable Medical Image
  Diagnosis","Models based on human-understandable concepts have received extensive
attention to improve model interpretability for trustworthy artificial
intelligence in the field of medical image analysis. These methods can provide
convincing explanations for model decisions but heavily rely on the detailed
annotation of pre-defined concepts. Consequently, they may not be effective in
cases where concepts or annotations are incomplete or low-quality. Although
some methods automatically discover effective and new visual concepts rather
than using pre-defined concepts or could find some human-understandable
concepts via large Language models, they are prone to veering away from medical
diagnostic evidence and are challenging to understand. In this paper, we
propose a concept complement bottleneck model for interpretable medical image
diagnosis with the aim of complementing the existing concept set and finding
new concepts bridging the gap between explainable models. Specifically, we
propose to use concept adapters for specific concepts to mine the concept
differences and score concepts in their own attention channels to support
almost fairly concept learning. Then, we devise a concept complement strategy
to learn new concepts while jointly using known concepts to improve model
performance. Comprehensive experiments on medical datasets demonstrate that our
model outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors in concept detection and
disease diagnosis tasks while providing diverse explanations to ensure model
interpretability effectively.",2024-10-20,2024,2024-10,medical

AI Readiness in Healthcare through Storytelling XAI,"Artificial Intelligence is rapidly advancing and radically impacting everyday
life, driven by the increasing availability of computing power. Despite this
trend, the adoption of AI in real-world healthcare is still limited. One of the
main reasons is the trustworthiness of AI models and the potential hesitation

(XAI) techniques aim to address these issues. However, explainability can mean
different things to people with different backgrounds, expertise, and goals. To
address the target audience with diverse needs, we develop storytelling XAI. In
this research, we have developed an approach that combines multi-task
distillation with interpretability techniques to enable audience-centric
explainability. Using multi-task distillation allows the model to exploit the
relationships between tasks, potentially improving interpretability as each
task supports the other leading to an enhanced interpretability from the
perspective of a domain expert. The distillation process allows us to extend
this research to large deep models that are highly complex. We focus on both
model-agnostic and model-specific methods of interpretability, supported by
textual justification of the results in healthcare through our use case. Our

zero-shot dense retrieval in the medical domain poses substantial challenges
due to the lack of relevance-labeled data. In this paper, we introduce a novel
approach called Self-Learning Hypothetical Document Embeddings (SL-HyDE) to
tackle this issue. SL-HyDE leverages large language models (LLMs) as generators
to generate hypothetical documents based on a given query. These generated
documents encapsulate key medical context, guiding a dense retriever in
identifying the most relevant documents. The self-learning framework
progressively refines both pseudo-document generation and retrieval, utilizing
unlabeled medical corpora without requiring any relevance-labeled data.
Additionally, we present the Chinese Medical Information Retrieval Benchmark
(CMIRB), a comprehensive evaluation framework grounded in real-world medical

"The Limited Impact of Medical Adaptation of Large Language and
  Vision-Language Models","Several recent works seek to adapt general-purpose large language models
(LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) for medical applications through
continued pretraining on publicly available biomedical corpora. These works
typically claim that such domain-adaptive pretraining improves performance on
various downstream medical tasks, such as answering medical exam questions. In
this paper, we compare ten ""medical"" LLMs and two VLMs against their
corresponding base models, arriving at a different conclusion: all medical VLMs
and nearly all medical LLMs fail to consistently improve over their base models
in the zero-/few-shot prompting and supervised fine-tuning regimes for medical
question answering (QA). For instance, on clinical-note-based QA tasks in the
3-shot setting, medical LLMs outperform their base models in only 26.7% of
cases, reach a (statistical) tie in 16.7% of cases, and perform significantly
worse in the remaining 56.7% of cases. Our conclusions are based on (i)
comparing each medical model directly against its base model; (ii) optimizing
the prompts for each model separately in zero-/few-shot prompting; and (iii)
accounting for statistical uncertainty in comparisons. Our findings suggest
that state-of-the-art general-domain models may already exhibit strong medical

A Benchmark for Long-Form Medical Question Answering,"There is a lack of benchmarks for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in
long-form medical question answering (QA). Most existing medical QA evaluation
benchmarks focus on automatic metrics and multiple-choice questions. While

existing studies on evaluating long-form answer generation in medical QA are
primarily closed-source, lacking access to human medical expert annotations,
which makes it difficult to reproduce results and enhance existing baselines.
In this work, we introduce a new publicly available benchmark featuring
real-world consumer medical questions with long-form answer evaluations

in-context demonstrations and those with specialized medical fine-tuning, have
demonstrated strong performance in medical language processing but struggle
with real-time adaptability, multi-step reasoning, and handling complex medical

patient, creating realistic intermediate disease state sequence. Finally, a
diffusion-based video transition generation model interpolates disease
progression between these states. We validate our framework across three
medical imaging domains: chest X-ray, fundus photography, and skin image. Our
results demonstrate that MVG significantly outperforms baseline models in
generating coherent and clinically plausible disease trajectories. Two user

sciences for improved diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of severe health
conditions. This paper focuses on the development of an ML model with high
predictive accuracy to classify arrhythmic electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. The
ECG signals datasets utilized in this study were sourced from the PhysioNet and
MIT-BIH databases. The research commenced with binary classification, where an
optimized Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) model yielded
excellent results in differentiating normal and atrial fibrillation signals. A
pivotal aspect of this research was a survey among medical professionals, which
not only validated the practicality of AI-based ECG classifiers but also
identified areas for improvement, including accuracy and the inclusion of more

"MMedPO: Aligning Medical Vision-Language Models with Clinical-Aware
  Multimodal Preference Optimization","The advancement of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has propelled their
application in the medical field. However, Medical LVLMs (Med-LVLMs) encounter
factuality challenges due to modality misalignment, where the models prioritize
textual knowledge over visual input, leading to hallucinations that contradict
information in medical images. Previous attempts to enhance modality alignment
in Med-LVLMs through preference optimization have inadequately mitigated
clinical relevance in preference data, making these samples easily
distinguishable and reducing alignment effectiveness. To address this
challenge, we propose MMedPO, a novel multimodal medical preference
optimization approach that considers the clinical relevance of preference
samples to enhance Med-LVLM alignment. MMedPO curates multimodal preference
data by introducing two types of dispreference: (1) plausible hallucinations
injected through target Med-LVLMs or GPT-4o to produce medically inaccurate
responses, and (2) lesion region neglect achieved through local lesion-noising,
disrupting visual understanding of critical areas. We then calculate clinical
relevance for each sample based on scores from multiple Med-LLMs and visual
tools, and integrate these scores into the preference optimization process as
weights, enabling effective alignment. Our experiments demonstrate that MMedPO
significantly enhances factual accuracy in Med-LVLMs, achieving substantial
improvements over existing preference optimization methods by averaging 14.2%
and 51.7% across the Med-VQA and report generation tasks. Our code are

"Performance of a large language model-Artificial Intelligence based
  chatbot for counseling patients with sexually transmitted infections and
  genital diseases","Introduction: Global burden of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is
rising out of proportion to specialists. Current chatbots like ChatGPT are not
tailored for handling STI-related concerns out of the box. We developed Otiz,
an Artificial Intelligence-based (AI-based) chatbot platform designed
specifically for STI detection and counseling, and assessed its performance.
Methods: Otiz employs a multi-agent system architecture based on GPT4-0613,
leveraging large language model (LLM) and Deterministic Finite Automaton
principles to provide contextually relevant, medically accurate, and empathetic
responses. Its components include modules for general STI information,
emotional recognition, Acute Stress Disorder detection, and psychotherapy. A
question suggestion agent operates in parallel. Four STIs (anogenital warts,
herpes, syphilis, urethritis/cervicitis) and 2 non-STIs (candidiasis, penile
cancer) were evaluated using prompts mimicking patient language. Each prompt
was independently graded by two venereologists conversing with Otiz as patient
actors on 6 criteria using Numerical Rating Scale ranging from 0 (poor) to 5
(excellent). Results: Twenty-three venereologists did 60 evaluations of 30
prompts. Across STIs, Otiz scored highly on diagnostic accuracy (4.1-4.7),
overall accuracy (4.3-4.6), correctness of information (5.0), comprehensibility
(4.2-4.4), and empathy (4.5-4.8). However, relevance scores were lower
(2.9-3.6), suggesting some redundancy. Diagnostic scores for non-STIs were
lower (p=0.038). Inter-observer agreement was strong, with differences greater
than 1 point occurring in only 12.7% of paired evaluations. Conclusions: AI

CareBot: A Pioneering Full-Process Open-Source Medical Language Model,"Recently, both closed-source LLMs and open-source communities have made
significant strides, outperforming humans in various general domains. However,
their performance in specific professional domains such as medicine, especially
within the open-source community, remains suboptimal due to the complexity of
medical knowledge. In this paper, we propose CareBot, a bilingual medical LLM,
which leverages a comprehensive approach integrating continuous pre-training
(CPT), supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning with human
feedback (RLHF). Our novel two-stage CPT method, comprising Stable CPT and
Boost CPT, effectively bridges the gap between general and domain-specific
data, facilitating a smooth transition from pre-training to fine-tuning and
enhancing domain knowledge progressively. We also introduce DataRater, a model
designed to assess data quality during CPT, ensuring that the training data is
both accurate and relevant. For SFT, we develope a large and diverse bilingual
dataset, along with ConFilter, a metric to enhance multi-turn dialogue quality,
which is crucial to improving the model's ability to handle more complex
dialogues. The combination of high-quality data sources and innovative
techniques significantly improves CareBot's performance across a range of
medical applications. Our rigorous evaluations on Chinese and English
benchmarks confirm CareBot's effectiveness in medical consultation and

"FAMNet: Frequency-aware Matching Network for Cross-domain Few-shot
  Medical Image Segmentation","Existing few-shot medical image segmentation (FSMIS) models fail to address a
practical issue in medical imaging: the domain shift caused by different

overcome this limitation, we focus on the cross-domain few-shot medical image
segmentation (CD-FSMIS) task, aiming to develop a generalized model capable of
adapting to a broader range of medical image segmentation scenarios with
limited labeled data from the novel target domain. Inspired by the
characteristics of frequency domain similarity across different domains, we
propose a Frequency-aware Matching Network (FAMNet), which includes two key
components: a Frequency-aware Matching (FAM) module and a Multi-Spectral Fusion

phase: 1) intra-domain variance caused by the inherent support-query bias, due
to the different appearances of organs and lesions, and 2) inter-domain
variance caused by different medical imaging techniques. Additionally, we
design an MSF module to integrate the different frequency features decoupled by
the FAM module, and further mitigate the impact of inter-domain variance on the

There is a need for more efficient methods that can achieve comparable or
superior diagnostic performance without the associated resource burden. We
investigated the feasibility of replacing conventional training procedures with
an embedding-based approach that leverages concise and semantically meaningful
representations of medical images. Using pre-trained foundational
models-specifically, convolutional neural networks (CNN) like ResNet and
multimodal models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)-we
generated image embeddings for multi-class classification tasks. Simple linear
classifiers were then applied to these embeddings. The approach was evaluated
across diverse medical imaging modalities, including retinal images,
mammography, dermatoscopic images, and chest radiographs. Performance was
compared to benchmark models trained and tested using traditional methods. The
embedding-based models surpassed the benchmark area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) scores by up to 87 percentage in
multi-class classification tasks across the various medical imaging modalities.
Notably, CLIP embedding models achieved the highest AUC-ROC scores,
demonstrating superior classification performance while significantly reducing
computational demands. Our study indicates that leveraging embeddings from
pre-trained foundational models can effectively replace conventional,

Overview of TREC 2024 Medical Video Question Answering (MedVidQA) Track,"One of the key goals of artificial intelligence (AI) is the development of a
multimodal system that facilitates communication with the visual world (image

support set, ICS propagates information forward and backward through the
sequence, ensuring inter-slice consistency. We evaluate the proposed method on
the HVSMR dataset, which includes segmentation tasks for eight cardiac regions.
Experimental results demonstrate that ICS significantly improves segmentation
performance in complex anatomical regions, particularly in maintaining boundary

modalities, like three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound, could unlock deeper
insights. Additionally, the lack of explainable AI (XAI) in most studies raises
concerns about the transparency and traceability of AI-driven decisions - key
factors for clinical adoption and trust. Furthermore, many studies relied on
single-center designs and small datasets, which limit the generalizability of
their findings. This review highlights the need for integrating advanced
imaging analysis techniques with explainable AI methodologies, as well as the
importance of leveraging multicenter collaborations and larger datasets.

"On the Compositional Generalization of Multimodal LLMs for Medical
  Imaging","Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold significant potential in the
medical field, but their capabilities are often limited by insufficient data in
certain medical domains, highlighting the need for understanding what kinds of
images can be used by MLLMs for generalization. Current research suggests that
multi-task training outperforms single-task as different tasks can benefit each
other, but they often overlook the internal relationships within these tasks,
providing limited guidance on selecting datasets to enhance specific tasks. To
analyze this phenomenon, we attempted to employ compositional generalization
(CG)-the ability of models to understand novel combinations by recombining
learned elements-as a guiding framework. Since medical images can be precisely
defined by Modality, Anatomical area, and Task, naturally providing an
environment for exploring CG. Therefore, we assembled 106 medical datasets to
create Med-MAT for comprehensive experiments. The experiments confirmed that
MLLMs can use CG to understand unseen medical images and identified CG as one
of the main drivers of the generalization observed in multi-task training.
Additionally, further studies demonstrated that CG effectively supports
datasets with limited data and delivers consistent performance across different
backbones, highlighting its versatility and broad applicability. Med-MAT is
publicly available at https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/Med-MAT.",2024-12-28,2024,2024-12,medical
"LLM-MedQA: Enhancing Medical Question Answering through Case Studies in
  Large Language Models","Accurate and efficient question-answering systems are essential for
delivering high-quality patient care in the medical field. While Large Language
Models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides across various domains, they
continue to face significant challenges in medical question answering,
particularly in understanding domain-specific terminologies and performing
complex reasoning. These limitations undermine their effectiveness in critical
medical applications. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach
incorporating similar case generation within a multi-agent medical
question-answering (MedQA) system. Specifically, we leverage the Llama3.1:70B
model, a state-of-the-art LLM, in a multi-agent architecture to enhance
performance on the MedQA dataset using zero-shot learning. Our method
capitalizes on the model's inherent medical knowledge and reasoning
capabilities, eliminating the need for additional training data. Experimental
results show substantial performance gains over existing benchmark models, with
improvements of 7% in both accuracy and F1-score across various medical QA
tasks. Furthermore, we examine the model's interpretability and reliability in
addressing complex medical queries. This research not only offers a robust
solution for medical question answering but also establishes a foundation for
broader applications of LLMs in the medical domain.",2024-12-31,2024,2024-12,medical
